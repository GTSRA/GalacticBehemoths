  civic_gts_bare: "Naked Tradition"
  civic_gts_bare_desc: "Thanks to their size or unique climate, the people of this civilization have never developed a consciousness of wearing clothes for warmth. Their cultural system does not consider nudity shameful, but rather promotes the beauty of form and skin. Although they have had to put on clothes according to galactic customs in the space age, their diplomats will tend to choose more revealing outfits to ease their discomfort."
  councilor_gts_bare: "Special Envoy"
  councilor_gts_bare_female: "Special Envoy"

  councilor_gts_bare_desc: "This well-trained diplomat can, through clever clothing choices, ensure that her body does not disrupt normal diplomatic activities due to excessive exposure, all while keeping key areas ventilated. However, judging from diplomatic feedback, this seductive attire is bringing more benefits to our diplomacy?"
  civic_gts_aryans: "Aryan Supermen"
  civic_gts_aryans_desc: "From the pre-space age, this nation has believed in a theory of racial superiority.  Strict eugenics and genetic modification policies have allowed them to possess power rivalling that of giantesses, despite their small size."
  councilor_gts_aryans: "Planning Committee Member"
  councilor_gts_aryans_female: "Planning Committee Member"

  councilor_gts_aryans_desc: "The Planning Committee Member is responsible for planning the production targets of various industries in our country for a period of time in the future. From screws to giant space warships, the empire's ability to keep up despite these physical limitations is all thanks to their dedication."
  civic_gts_city: "Hive City Planet"
  civic_gts_city_desc: "This nation places great emphasis on the development of industrial power and clusters its industrial districts around several large urban areas. To maximize production efficiency, they have greatly shortened military service and disregard the potential hazards of concentrated industry during war.\n\"As long as industrial output is large enough, a massive navy will protect our home, and how could enemies possibly invade our planet?\" This is what the citizens of this territory think with such optimism."
  councilor_gts_city: "Industrial Overseer"
  councilor_gts_city_female: "Industrial Overseer"

  councilor_gts_city_desc: "The industrial administrator, whose sole job is to ensure maximum production efficiency. Her relationships and her skills in handling various situations contribute greatly to increasing the construction speed of planetary industrial infrastructure."
  civic_gts_country: "Skyfall Anxieties"
  civic_gts_country_desc: "This nation has, for some reason, harbored anxieties about invasions by enormous extraterrestrial beings since the early days of civilization. From ancient towering spires to modern and varied anti-aircraft weapons, this country is still obsessed with strengthening planetary defense at the expense of production efficiency.\nTo outsiders, it seems a case of worrying about nothing... perhaps?"
  councilor_gts_country: "Planetary Defense General"
  councilor_gts_country_female: "Planetary Defense General"

  councilor_gts_country_desc: "This officer is responsible for leading the security preparations of the homeworld and other vital points. Even if they cannot eliminate an invading giantess, the complex and dazzling firepower network on the starbase might be able to force them to retreat."
  civic_origin_from_micro: "Origins in the Microcosm"
  civic_origin_from_micro_desc: "A small population was once a bottleneck preventing this empire from entering high-speed development. Large-scale imports of alien populations or mass cloning would also bring serious side effects. Forced to do so, they placed their hopes on gigantification technology. Through genetic modification and guided direction of microbial communities, these microbial civilizations, which are genetically related to our own, will cultivate the most outstanding talent with the full power of their civilization, who will be “ascended,” and that is to be magnified to our size by gigantification hormones. These selected, outstanding individuals are granted citizenship, and the microcosm where the giantess was born is left to her as a memento."
  civic_origin_from_micro_effects: "Unlocks a special building that consumes £gts_micro_city£$gts_micro_city$ and £energy£$energy$ to assemble a large number of pops.\nPops assembled gain a §Yproduction bonus§!.\n§ROnly Giantess civilizations can use this civic.§!"
  origin_from_micro_modifier: "Ascended Microorganism"
  councilor_origin_from_micro: "Microcosm Incubator"
  councilor_origin_from_micro_female: "Microcosm Incubator"

  councilor_origin_from_micro_desc: "The Microcosm Incubator is, in a sense, the mother of every microcosm, and the existence most revered and feared by each person to ascend from the microcosm."
  civic_changeling: "Changeling"
  civic_changeling_desc: "In this civilization, giantesses and small people are not simply a relationship between master and toy. Strictly speaking, they are a symbiotic entity, consisting of two girls of different sizes who share senses, names and social relationships. One of them, the giantess, who is temporarily in the dominant position, rules over the other small person, who is in a subordinate position. When the giantess is emotionally agitated, orgasmic, or actively gives up their role, the sizes of the giantess and small person will swap. This 'variable size' trait causes problems for their own administration, and also makes it incredibly difficult for any other civilization to interact with them."
  councilor_changeling: "Imperial Census Director"
  councilor_changeling_female: "Imperial Census Director"

  councilor_changeling_desc: "Carrying out a census in a symbiotic empire is much more difficult than in regular Giantess or small person empires, but the empire has not experienced many population disputes, thanks to the adeptness of the Imperial Census Director."
  civic_ub_ritual: "Intra-Vaginal Greeting Ritual"
  civic_ub_ritual_desc: "This society has developed a unique set of social etiquettes. Specifically, the giantess expresses friendliness by inserting a small person into her lower body when greeting them, and the small person expresses friendliness by voluntarily entering the lower body of the other's giantess when greeting. This shocking social custom has brought a great deal of...cultural conflict to visiting foreign dignitaries, and this tradition is difficult to change in the short term. Perhaps it would be more realistic for aliens to embrace this culture?"
  civic_ub_ritual_effects: "§RBoth Giantesses and small people are obsessed with Intra-Vaginal insertion.§!\n§RPopulation and leaders are more prone to it.§!"
  councilor_ub_ritual: "Foreign Affairs Etiquette Officer"
  councilor_ub_ritual_female: "Foreign Affairs Etiquette Officer"

  councilor_ub_ritual_desc: "More and more giantesses and small people are gradually letting go of their inner prejudices and embracing the primal desires that walk the line between flesh and reason, thanks to the Foreign Affairs Etiquette Officer's effective propaganda."
  civic_focus_gts_fluid: "Sister-Juice Economy"
  civic_focus_gts_fluid_desc: "The most direct impact of our space age experiences has been on our economic life. Giantess bodily fluids, this fascinating substance has been extremely popular since it first entered our market, and it is now even sufficient to circulate as a form of physical currency among small person countries. Energy credits are still the standard by which a nation's economic strength is measured, but sufficient reserves of fresh giantess fluid have clearly become the cornerstone of stabilizing investor confidence."
  civic_focus_gts_fluid_effects: "Grant national modifier based on monthly £gts_giantess_fluid£$gts_giantess_fluid$ reserves.\n§ROnly small people civilizations can use this civic§!"

  tiny_focus_gts_fluid_4: "Sister-Juice Essence: Level 2"
  tiny_focus_gts_fluid_5: "Sister-Juice Essence: Level 1"
  civic_focus_tiny: "Small Person Economy"
  civic_focus_tiny_desc: "The most direct impact of our space age experiences has been on our economic life. Since the appearance of shrunken humans as commodities in interstellar markets, they have been sought after by giantesses. Now they even circulate as a form of physical currency among giantess nations. Energy credits are still the standard for measuring national economic strength, but a sufficient stockpile of healthy small people is clearly the cornerstone of stabilizing investor confidence."
  civic_focus_tiny_effects: "Grants national modifier based on monthly £gts_micro£$gts_micro$ reserves. \n§ROnly Giantess civilizations can use this civic§!"
  gts_focus_tiny_1: "Small Person Essence: Level 5"

  gts_focus_tiny_4: "Small Person Essence: Level 2"

  gts_focus_tiny_5: "Small Person Essence: Level 1"
  civic_distinguished_gts: "Distinguished Giantess Education"
  civic_distinguished_gts_desc: "The experiences of the space age have reshaped our worldview. Since we belong to the giantess species that was born to rule the galaxy, we must adjust our educational focus to meet the needs of our society. By reducing some of the traditional education content that can be handled by small people, more important courses, such as Sex Theory, Principles and Use of Masturbation Devices, City Destruction Studies, etc. will therefore be included in every giantess's compulsory curriculum."
  civic_distinguished_gts_effects: "§ROnly Giantess civilizations can use this civic§!"
  councilor_distinguished_gts: "Giantess Education Commissioner"
  councilor_distinguished_gts_female: "Giantess Education Commissioner"

  councilor_distinguished_gts_desc: "It is hard to imagine that a giant young woman who has studied at the academy for several years would stand helplessly in a small city and be used as a live target. We must strengthen the education of all giantesses!"
  civic_titan_hunter: "Titan Hunter"
  civic_titan_hunter_desc: "Giantesses are one of the enemies you will encounter most often as an imperial soldier. Defeating them, taking their spoils, will earn you supreme glory.  At long range, giantesses are no match for disciplined imperial armies, they will easily be suppressed by fire and quickly annihilated.  A single giantess is also not much of a threat, because hidden under their huge bodies is a lack of coordination and low intelligence. In combat, you will often find that giantesses are more likely to flee in panic than risk death to fight you.  Using an entrenching tool or a nice, sharp bayonet is enough to bring them down. After that you just need to stab their bare, vulnerable flesh a few times with your bayonet. We hope you enjoy this instructional guide, because you will soon have the opportunity to put these new skills into practice. -Excerpt from the *Imperial Military Department Handbook*."

  civic_titan_hunter_effects: "Slightly lowers the §Yopinion§! giantess empires have of you.\n§ROnly small person civilizations can use this civic§!"
