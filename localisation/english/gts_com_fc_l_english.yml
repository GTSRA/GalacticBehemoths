  first_contactgts.100.desc: "§HThe little people's ship was brought back by [This.Leader.GetName] in her mouth, with both the ship and the people inside successfully preserved!§!\n\nOur giantess field agent quietly used the asteroid belt as cover to approach the tiny spacecraft. [This.Leader.GetName] first locked onto the little people working on the surface of an asteroid, extending her tongue and licking them into her mouth. The crew of the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! exploration ship realized something was wrong too late. The giantess lunged forward, and the crew watched helplessly as her abyss-like giant mouth rapidly grew in their view. In the next instant, the ship was completely intact within [This.Leader.GetName]'s mouth. Due to the obstruction of her lips, the little people held within could not send out a distress signal. Thus, they were successfully taken back by our giantess agent.\n\nAfter returning to the space station, [This.Leader.GetName] spat out her 'prisoners of war'. The ship, covered in sticky saliva, was largely intact except for the completely crushed rear section. In the puddle of fragrant saliva that surrounded the ship, there were many floating black dots. These poor insects, who had been licked into her mouth, did not survive the humid heat. [This.Leader.GetName] explained that the ship was damaged because she kept licking the little people in her mouth the whole way back. The little ship tasted like a candy to her, so she couldn't help but take a bite. Fortunately, our little people engineers, after wiping it clean and sawing open the hull, found some survivors. Although the hull breach caused a large amount of saliva to flood in, the humid environment and the flood still did not take the lives of these little people.\n\nWe now know that they are a §H[This.ContactCountry.Species.GetAAnSpeciesClass]§! §H[This.ContactCountry.Species.GetClass]§! species.

  ## Ship captured, but no people (Feet)
  first_contactgts.260.name: "Little People Ship Captured Successfully... Sort Of"
  first_contactgts.260.desc: "§HThe little people's ship was brought back by [This.Leader.GetName] in her boot. The ship was preserved, but the crew died under her black silk giantess feet!§!\n\n[This.Leader.GetName] ambushed the ship in an asteroid belt, waiting for it to approach. However, the ship spotted her early and made an emergency maneuver, dodging her giant hand that was trying to intercept them. It then attempted to flee from beneath her body. In order to prevent the enemy ship from escaping, and also to minimize damage during capture, our agent quickly kicked off her boot, intercepting the enemy ship's path. The ship was forced to change course because of the giantess, and [This.Leader.GetName] seized the opportunity, immediately surrounding it with her feet, ordering them to turn off their engines and surrender. However, they did not seem to understand our language and still tried to escape, so the giantess didn't hesitate, and closed her black silk feet.\n\nWith a 'thud', the tiny ship instantly disappeared between the black giant walls. Her silk stockings tightly sealed together. When the giant feet opened again, the ship had been tightly wrapped in her black silk toe. The giantess held it between her toes, and no matter how much its thrusters accelerated, it could not escape her foot. And the socked feet, which had been trapped in the boot for a long time, were now emitting heat and sweat, forming a 'white mist' around the toes, which enveloped the ship along with the black silk stockings. [This.Leader.GetName] lifted her foot and found that the ship's outer shell had been cracked by what had just happened.  Only because of the tight wrapping of the black silk did the ship not disintegrate. With no other choice, our giantess could only continue to hold the ship with her feet, and put her foot with the ship still in her toes back into her boot. The airtight environment inside the boot could ensure that the ship's air tightness was not overly damaged.\n\nBut [This.Leader.GetName] actually forgot about her 'prisoners' in the boot. Only when she went to bed back at the base did she remember the small, uncomfortable stones. She rushed to the recovery area and poured out the small spacecraft from her boot. The ship was already severely damaged, and half of it was stuck to her black silk because it was covered in foot sweat.  This pile of black-silk marinated wreckage no longer showed any signs of life.  On the way back, the steam and sweat in the boot had penetrated the ship due the hull breach, and the heavy odor suffocated most of the crew. Afterwards the giantess walked around the base, her feet heat gradually increased, the smell also intensified, and the repeated trampling of the black silk feet further disintegrated the ship's structure. The last survivors donned protective suits and tried to leave the ship, climbing along the fibers of her leg, but these little people were crushed onto her stockings when she took her shoes off..."

  ## Ship and people destroyed (Genitals)
  first_contactgts.270.name: "Little People Ship Destroyed"
  first_contactgts.270.desc: "§HThe little people's ship was stuffed into [This.Leader.GetName]'s honey hole, and due to the ship's stimulation to her lower body, the ship was completely crushed into powder by her!§!\n\nWhile their little ship was still cruising leisurely, our giantess field agent had quietly approached them. Using the cover of the dark side of the planet and our advanced stealth technology, when the other side's searchlight discovered the giantess, her giant hand with a white satin glove had already stretched out in front of the spaceship. The ship was immediately seized in the giantess' hand. The little people conducting extravehicular activities around the ship immediately activated their jetpacks and tried to escape, but the other giant hand reached out and with a soft squeeze, captured these ant-like people all at once, crushing them in her hand. [This.Leader.GetName] was still immersed in her joy of victory, when suddenly the ship in her hand fired at her but the little people's weapon couldn't even break the giantess' glove. 'These little things actually dare to attack me', the giantess decided to punish them properly. She checked the ship's measurements and came up with an idea.\n\nThe giantess adjusted her posture, lifted her skirt, and her pure white fingertips took off her panties, pinching the little people's ship and bringing it closer to her already slightly wet fleshy hole. Then, the engorged labia were spread open with her fingers, and the giantess pressed the little people's ship around her clitoris, rubbing it quickly.  The weapons and communication antennas, etc., on the outer edge of the ship were completely rubbed off in this process, and the hull was also covered with the giantess' love fluid. As the giantess' moans grew louder, the foreplay was almost over, and the ship was pushed into the 'depths of the cave', where the surrounding flesh walls seemed to welcome these alien visitors, constantly contracting and expanding with each contraction, the enormous pressure causing the ship's structure to make sounds of agony. Soon, the last section of the ship's bow also disappeared into the 'hole'. [This.Leader.GetName] was very satisfied with the little spoils of war imprisoned in her lower body. She put on her panties, and tidied her clothing, preparing to return. However, the ship within her flesh hole suddenly ignited, trying to overload its engines and burst upwards. But it backfired, the flames from the ship's engine went along the flesh walls of the little hole, straight to the cervix deep within the vagina. This sudden intense stimulation made the giantess let out a loud moan, she subconsciously tightened her legs, and the flesh hole encompassing the ship burst together.\n\nWith a faint 'squish' sound, a ship representing the most advanced technology of the little people, was squished into dust during a girl's masturbation. Along with the spurting love fluid, it stuck to her panties"

As her toes rubbed together, the little people's struggles grew weaker and weaker. After she squished one, she would move on to the next.

They show no respect for our people, we must do something!!"

  first_contactgts.356.desc.gts: "After completing their capture, these savage giantesses are not satisfied. They have enlarged their bodies further, now thousands of times our size, and are stomping through city, most buildings barely reaching their ankles. Countless structures are flattened by their black soles as they casually walk about. The number of casualties is skyrocketing, and our fleet will not arrive for some time! For now, we can only speed up the evacuation of civilians in the surrounding areas."

  first_contactgts.357.desc.gts: "One giantess seems to have taken a liking to the train we're using for civilian evacuation. The giantess lifted her heel out of her shoe, and then with a mighty back swing, flung her shoe outwards! The enormous shoe hurtled towards the train like a meteor, after the ear-splitting crash, not only was the train destroyed, but the city blocks for dozens of kilometers behind the point of impact were flattened. The shoe stands in the city ruins like a volcano, with plumes of white mist constantly rising from the \"crater\". Who knows how much secondary damage this will cause to the city?"

  ## Sockfoot or Barefoot Event
  # Stage 1
  first_contactgts.1010.name: "Foot Worship"
  first_contactgts.1010.desc: "Based on our investigation into the numerous works of art of §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§!, §Ythe feet of giant women§! have a very high rate of appearance. While most consider feet a dirty part of the body, they treat it as a sacred totem. From the images we have found, in their culture, giantesses even show their love by stepping on their lovers with the tips of their toes, in a similar manner to how we kiss. \n\nIf they really like giantess feet so much, maybe we can §Ytreat§! them well during first contact~"

  first_contactgts.1010.A: "How can there be foot fetishists in space!"
  # Stage 2
  first_contactgts.1011.name: "Foot Fetishists?"
  first_contactgts.1011.desc: "As we delved further into our investigation of §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! -- which we know now is §H[This.ContactCountry.GetRealName]§! -- we have finally determined that their culture does indeed include the worship of the feet of giantesses like us!\n\nIn diplomatic and formal events, larger women will remove their shoes and hold out their steaming giant feet to the little people, who then must kiss the toes to greet them. In response, the giantesses will step on the little people, surrounding them with the soft soles of their feet and the sweat and scents from their feet. This is considered a sign of intimacy because a giantess's soles are a very private place. The highest form of greeting is to place the little person between both feet and rub them like that.\n\nFurthermore, whether the giantess is wearing socks or not, the type of sock she is wearing, how much she has sweated, how strong the smell is, all affect the suitability of this social ritual. However, our scientists can only speculate about the specific rules, so when we meet with their ambassador, we must act based only on our assumptions..."
  first_contactgts.1011.A: "Why are we worrying about any of this? If they like feet so much, just crush them!"

  first_contactgts.1011.B: "Send for our ladies with the most foot experience, we can't mistreat their ambassador ~"
  # Stage 3 - Decide which to step with
  first_contactgts.1012.name: "Treating the [This.ContactCountry.GetName] Ambassador"
  first_contactgts.1012.desc: "§H\"Here, this is their envoy, it took a lot of effort to catch them!\"§! A minuscule creature, one centimeter in height is casually thrown to the ground.\n§H\"My stockings are two days old, surely she'll like them~\"§! An impatient young woman has already removed her small leather shoes, and raised her foot, ready to crush the little person.\n§H\"Wait, remember what the humanities department said? They have requirements about what their giantesses wear when stepping on them.\"§! A researcher, dressed in a school uniform, stopped the excited woman, §H\"I think she'd prefer my student socks, the cotton socks are much more comfortable.\"§!\n§H\"Yes, cotton socks are more absorbent, I can see your socks are so wet they could drown her! I think to express friendship we should take off our socks, and let her have some intimate contact with our bare feet!\"§!\n\nThe pitiable envoy can only cower on the ground, trembling, watching these giant women argue in a language they cannot understand, and their giant feet, clad in various types of shoes and socks, dropping down around them, the air starting to fill with a young woman's scent... So, how should we choose?"
  first_contactgts.1012.A: "Stockings, who doesn't like sexy stockings?"
  first_contactgts.1012.B: "Cotton socks are good, soft and able to wrap her up."
  first_contactgts.1012.C: "Barefoot has to be the best, let her lick it well~"
  first_contactgts.1012.Tooltip: "If our choice fits their fetish, they will be very §Gimpressed§!, but if we make the wrong choice they'll feel §Hinsulted§!.\n"
  first_contactgts.1012.D: "Ugh, I'm annoyed. Everyone just all go at once."
  # Stage 4 - Stockings Correct
  first_contactgts.1013.name: "Ice Cream or Chocolate?"
  first_contactgts.1013.desc: "After discussion, we decided to use §Hstockings§!.\n\nThe young woman from the diplomatic department wore white stockings on her left foot and black stockings on her right. The tiny envoy was surrounded by the huge soles of her feet.\n\"Will she really like this? I am so embarrassed...\" The young woman's face flushed red.\nBut we seem to have made the right choice! The envoy was afraid at first, but soon began to look at the black and white walls around them with anticipation, seemingly hesitating which foot to approach. In response, our young woman obediently brought her feet together, the silk feet, still radiating heat having just been pulled from the shoes, and promptly trapped the tiny person between the tips of her toes-the place where the sweat is most concentrated and the smell the strongest. The young woman slowly rubbed her toes about, feeling the envoy struggle between her stocking-clad feet.\n\nWe do not know what the envoy experienced, but when the girl finally released her feet, the exhausted envoy lay on the ground, a happy smile on her face."
  first_contactgts.1013.A: "Children choose, I want it all!"
  first_contactgts.1013.B: "Before we send her off, should we try cotton socks to see if she likes them?"

  first_contactgts.1013.C: "Or barefoot?"
  # Stage 4 - Stockings Incorrect

  first_contactgts.1014.desc: "After discussion, we decided to use §Hstockings§!.\n\nThe young woman from the diplomatic department wore white stockings on her left foot and black stockings on her right. The huge undersides of her feet surrounded the tiny envoy.\n\"Will she really like this? I am so embarrassed...\" the young woman's face flushed red.\nTheir envoy first looked with horror at the black and white walls slowly drawing closer, then clutched their nose and began to cough painfully. The material of stockings means they are not very absorbent, and having been trapped in shoes all day, it isn’t hard to imagine the horrible odor coming from the sweaty stockings.\nAs the silk feet came together, the small person’s moans disappeared and was replaced with the soft rubbing of the stockings. That cloned envoy was still trapped between the tips of the young woman's toes-the place where sweat is most concentrated and the smell the strongest. The young woman slowly rubbed her toes about, feeling the envoy struggle between her stocking-clad feet. \n\nWe do not know what the envoy experienced, but when the girl finally released her feet, the envoy was like a corpse and had passed out."
  first_contactgts.1014.A: "What an unappreciative little thing!"
  first_contactgts.1014.B: "Wake her up and try again with cotton socks."

  first_contactgts.1014.C: "Or try barefoot."

  first_contactgts.1015.desc: "After discussion, we decided to use §Hcotton socks§!.\n\nA young woman who had just returned from going out volunteered for the task. She took off her sneakers, and the giant feet encased in white mid-calf cotton socks stepped next to the small envoy.\n\"It's so hot today, my feet are much more comfortable after taking off my shoes~\" The giant woman said as she wiped the sweat off her forehead and sat down.\nThe vapor from the giant white socks quickly formed a layer of mist on the ground, outlining the shape of the huge feet.\n\"Well, let's get started, come on, come in~\" The woman brought her feet together, playfully wiggling the toes encased in the cotton socks. Thick, absorbent white cotton socks are very comfortable and popular with the girls. The envoy hesitated at first but was gradually drawn by the heat and scent from the giant foot, slowly approaching the white behemoth.\nThe steaming warm feet had become the envoy's haven. The young woman brought her feet together, tightly wrapping the small person in her cotton sock and rhythmically rubbing them. The sweat squeezed from the sock worked as a lubricant, ensuring that her skin was not frayed by the rough fabric of the sock.\n\nWe do not know what the envoy experienced, but when the girl finally released her feet, the envoy that was stuck to the sole of her sock had a happy smile on their face."
  first_contactgts.1015.A: "How wonderful, I also want to be stepped on by a big sister's cotton sock feet."
  first_contactgts.1015.B: "How about we let her enjoy stockings as well?"

Thick, absorbent white cotton socks are very comfortable, but being stuck in between them, especially the feet that had been out moving all day, may not be comfortable for the enclosed small person. The young woman, ignoring the terror in the envoy's eyes, clamped her feet together, tightly enveloping the small person in her cotton sock, and rubbed them up. The sweat squeezed out from the sock acted as a lubricant, ensuring her skin was not frayed by the rough fabric of the sock, but also robbed her of her right to breathe. Each time the envoy struggled to pull her face away from the sole of the sock to breathe, in addition to inhaling the intense smell, she also was given a mouthful of foot sweat.\n\nWe do not know what the envoy experienced, but when the girl finally released her feet, the envoy was like a corpse and had passed out."
  first_contactgts.1016.A: "Woah, so much sweat?"
  first_contactgts.1016.B: "Take her out, let's try with stockings."

After removing her shoes and socks, a pair of perfect jade feet were presented before the small envoy.\n\"Such a cute little thing, stepping on her will make her cry for a long time~\" A mocking expression appeared on the young woman's face.\nAlthough the young woman had just taken off her socks, the sweat was already starting to bead on  her rounded toes. Faced with the giant foot approaching, the small envoy did not retreat but instead closed the distance. The giant toes quickly captured the small person, rubbing them around between her feet. The small person’s fragile body was rolling over and over in the warm and moist soles, their faces repeatedly buried in the sweat-filled soft flesh.\n\nWe do not know what the envoy experienced, but when the girl finally released her feet, the envoy, was disheveled with a happy smile on their face."
  first_contactgts.1017.A: "Can I lick too?"

With a quick move, she trapped the tiny person between her feet, and the small person’s fragile body kept rolling on the warm moist sole of the foot.

  GTS_TIN_OVERLORD_GREETING_03: "What what? Several of your cities have been flattened by some big ones? Outrageous...... prepare the fleet, no one but us can play with you!"
  ## Declare War
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_GTST_Tin: "Ready to die, little [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? It doesn't matter if you aren't, the giantesses are at your door right now!"
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_GTST_Gts: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are severely hindering our plans for cleaning up the small bugs, we've decided to clean you up first!"
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_GTSA_Tin: "It's time for our fusion, eh? You didn't agree? That doesn't matter, we don't need your opinion~"
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_GTSA_Gts: "If you are not willing to assist our small person observation plan, then we will enforce it upon you, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_GTSS_Tin: "Big sister doesn't want this either, but for uncooperative little ones, we must apply mandatory protection measures."
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_GTSS_Gts: "Enough! We will no longer let you hurt those little guys, we will carry out justice on behalf of the heavens today!"
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_Tin_Gts: "The days of us trembling in your massive shadows are over! Our military might will show you who the true power is!"
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_Gts_Tin_01: "Our patience has reached its limit, little bugs. If you want to leave a few pitiful of your citizens behind as our foot-bugs, then it's still time to surrender now."
  01_DOW_PROPOSE_Gts_Tin_02: "Want to know how the giantesses crush stars with their fingers, and knead small person planets with their toe tips? You will soon see it for yourselves."

  01_DOW_PROPOSE_Gts_Tin_03: "We have prepared spacious lodgings for you in [Root.GetRulerName]'s panties and shoes and socks, now is the time to bring you over…"
  ## Accept Declaration of War
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_GTST_Tin: "So eager to die? You willingly came to our doorstep, good, we do not mind having another dish for tonight."
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_GTST_Gts: "What? After seeing how vicious we treat those small bugs, you still dare to provoke us? Alright, we'll play with you!"
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_GTSA_Tin: "Eh?! Experimental data can fight back? How cute."
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_GTSA_Gts: "Why do you disturb our experiments, you annoying [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_GTSS_Tin: "What are you doing?! This is not something a good child would do."
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_GTSS_Gts: "Bring it on, we will not let those little ones get hurt."
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_Tin_Gts: "Is it not enough to play with our people? Why do you have to go further! Don't underestimate us, we will resist to the end!"
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_Gts_Tin_01: "Bugs that dare to declare war on giantesses… There’s only one destiny that awaits you."
  01_DOW_ACCEPT_Gts_Tin_02: "It seems that our gentleness gave you the wrong impression… never mind, we will very soon tell you about the insurmountable gap between the giantesses and small people."

  01_DOW_ACCEPT_Gts_Tin_03: "Why do you do this? Is it simply because we recently used several dozen of your planets and hundreds of millions of your citizens ~?"
  ## Consider Peace
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_GTST_Tin: "We are considering your proposal."
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_GTST_Gts: "We are considering your proposal."
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_GTSA_Tin: "We are considering your proposal."
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_GTSA_Gts: "We are considering your proposal."
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_GTSS_Tin: "We are considering your proposal."
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_GTSS_Gts: "We are considering your proposal."
  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_Tin_Gts: "We are considering your proposal."

  01_PEACE_CONSIDER_Gts_Tin: "We are considering your proposal."
  ## Propose Peace
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_GTST_Tin: "Stop, stop! I was wrong, don't fight anymore, I promise not to stuff you in my shoes anymore, okay!"
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_GTST_Gts: "Fighting with you is not as fun as stepping on the small people, let's stop this war as soon as possible."
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_GTSA_Tin: "Okay...we will release the ones we've inserted in our lower parts, let's stop the war."
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_GTSA_Gts: "You have your own important things to do as well, let us stop here and go back to deal with the little people."
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_GTSS_Tin: "Little ones… big sister knows that she was wrong, I promise to treat you better, does that work for you?"
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_GTSS_Gts: "Let's retreat [Root.GetSpeciesName], and stop causing more giantess and small people casualties..."
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_Tin_Gts: "Please stop, give our civilization a way out, this is the condition we offer: "
  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_Gts_Tin: "Now we know that the size difference cannot stop you...we request a ceasefire."

  01_PEACE_PROPOSE_Gts_Tin_02: "Damn it...the losses have exceeded our expectations, we did not expect that you insignificant beings to possess such strength..."
  ## Accept Peace
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_GTST_Tin: "Hmph, sisters, let's go! But don’t let your guard down, we will come again."
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_GTST_Gts: "Alright alright, let us agree on withdrawing the troops, finally I can be free to go back to crushing those little bugs."
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_GTSA_Tin: "That’s it? We hope that those small people that you promised will be sent to our planet as soon as possible."
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_GTSA_Gts: "As expected, we were still skilled enough, hope that you won't interfere with our experiments again."
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_GTSS_Tin: "Hmm... you really are a sensible child. Okay, big sister won't bully you, don’t cry."
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_GTSS_Gts: "Thank you for your cooperation, we agree to cease fire, hope that you can assist us in the resettlement of the small people refugees"
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_Tin_Gts: "Okay… we agree to cease fire, you giantesses are not allowed to take anything with you while retreating!"
  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_Gts_Tin: "Looks like the brains of you little bugs can think things out after all, our giantesses agree to withdraw the troops."

  01_PEACE_ACCEPT_Gts_Tin_02: "It seems that you have finally recognized your place. So, now, let's talk about the territories that will be given to us as toys and consumables~"
  ## Refuse Peace
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_GTST_Tin: "Hmm~ Licking very diligently there? Ceasefire? I do not recall ever agreeing to that, hahaha~"
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_GTST_Gts: "No, I think it is more fun to abuse you than to step on the little bugs."
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_GTSA_Tin: "I think our fusion plan is going very smoothly at the moment, we have no need of your laughable proposal"
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_GTSA_Gts: "Ceasefire? Impossible, we have to ask you to return the experiment materials that we have lost."
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_GTSS_Tin: "Stop joking around, you just have to lie down obediently and wait for big sister to come pick you up."
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_GTSS_Gts: "We refuse to cease fire under such a situation, you are too much of a threat to the little people."
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_Tin_Gts: "We will not stop fighting until every giantess falls, or every small person is crushed!"
  01_PEACE_REFUSE_Gts_Tin: "I feel that the feeling of [Root.GetSpeciesName] exploding under my foot is not too bad, I refuse to cease fire."


  01_PEACE_REFUSE_Gts_Tin_02: "Want to give up now? Sure～ Wait until your homeworld is used by our girls as deodorant beads, and your citizens are used as consumables, then give up your dignity and status as a human being~"
