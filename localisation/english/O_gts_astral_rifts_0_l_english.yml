Most of the terrain higher than the ground has been weathered smooth, while the ground consists of regularly arranged arcuate ridges and bottomless, dark valleys.\n\nAs far as the eye can see, the irregular rock blocks scattered about are not quite the same color as the ground, the former being yellowish-brown and the latter being gray-white. When we sampled these rocks, we found that their surfaces were soft and their interiors dense, but the cause of the loose surface layer did not seem to be weathering, but rather an extremely high water content?\n\nDark clouds cover the sky above, and the sky is pitch black, with only faint light diffusing from behind the thick clouds. When another gust of howling wind swept down from the sky over the plain and into the valley, there were some bright gas clouds violently erupting between the distant cloud clusters.\n\nThe environmental sensors indicate that both the humidity and temperature of the air here are rising sharply with the gale. We should find a sheltered place as soon as possible to avoid the coming storm. According to the results of the meteorological sensors, the airflow at stratospheric altitude is relatively mild, and we can avoid the dangerous downbursts there.

As we try to get closer, we perceive that behind this net is a giant wall, and its vertical movement is even more exaggerated.\n\nWind constantly sweeps over our ship, and as we approach the range of the giant wall's undulations, each gust of wind becomes more violent. The strong signals from the biosensors confirm our guess - §YWe are beneath the sole of a giantess!§!\n\nEven more astonishingly, another faint biological signal around us seems to change regularly with the airflow. These airflows are not just a special weather pattern, their behavior is also unusually precise. More importantly, we discovered a hormone-like compound in the swirling air. Subsequent analysis showed that this was strikingly similar to the biological reaction of plants when attacked."

We even discovered that some airflows carry hair-like encoding substances, which regulate the morphology of this $gts_wind_creatures$.\n\nIn this gentle flow of air, we were gradually pushed back to the ground, where the storm has subsided as the giantess's foot ceased its activities."

  gts_astral_rift.2720.name: "Among the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$"
  gts_astral_rift.2720.desc: "We used the fungal synapses of the neural network to access this $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ network and attempted to send a short pulse; suddenly, every mushroom cap tightened immediately, apparently confused by a new signal on their internal network. As a test and response, we received a large number of signals, based on which we finally deciphered the fungal communication method.\n\nThe conclusion is that this $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ is a hive mind that sees itself as the guardian of the indigenous species of this 'planet'. Beneath the surface, a variety of flora and fauna are preserved and protected by the hyphal network. In exchange, the fungus takes their waste as food.\n\nHowever, something is threatening this symbiosis and the continued survival of the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ itself."

  gts_astral_rift.2725.desc: "We have returned to the plains, which should now be called the giantess's shoe insole. The thick cloud layer floating above it is obviously the perspiration of the giantess's foot. Although the insole is almost flat and not suitable for most life to live in, the abundant foot gunk resources under the giantess's foot still provide sufficient survival resources for the life $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$. Some spore-radiating fungal clusters inhabit every cotton-mesh rift and crevice enriched with foot gunk.\n\nThe airflow that carried us here gently sweeps across the ground, releasing bundles of fluffy aerial reproductive structures. These reproductive structures, wrapped in genetic material, float to the ground, but most are quickly broken down by the thin blanket formed by the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$.\n\nThe few surviving reproductive structures attach to the bare terrain, forming conical hydroids that provide a stable and protected environment for the safe maturation of the $gts_wind_creatures$.\n\nApparently, the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ prevents the reproduction of the $gts_wind_creatures$. In turn, the $gts_wind_creatures$ are constantly plundering the surface of the insole plain, forcing the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ to retreat into the most hidden foot gunk valleys."

  gts_astral_rift.2730.desc: "The $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ group led us back to the entrance of the rift valley, where the storm had subsided as the giantess's foot ceased its activities.\n\nA small reptilian creature hesitated for a moment in front of the foot gunk rift and then entered the open insole wilderness. Almost at the same time, a strong wind swept the poor reptile into the air.\n\nThere was nothing we could do but watch it be cut into smaller and smaller fragments and then broken down by the digestive structures in the air.\n\nOutside the sanctuary formed by the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$, life on the surface is completely dominated by the carnivorous airflow. Considering its precision and responsiveness, we can be sure that these airflows are, at least to some extent, sentient. And very hungry.\n\nWe call them $gts_wind_creatures$."

  gts_astral_rift.2735.desc: "Going deep into the shoe insole rift, we approached a group of spore-radiating $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$. The results of tissue sample analysis show that this $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ population is a highly complex hive mind. It conducts complex network communications by transmitting rapid electric pulse signals between nodes.\n\nWe used the fungal synapses of the neural network to access this network and attempted to send a short electrical current; every fungal cap tightened suddenly, apparently confused by a new player in their internal network. As a test and response, we received a large number of signals, the meaning of which is still unknown."

We found a pheromone similar to $gts_giantess_fluid$ in those samples and analyzed it in depth.\n\nThese pheromones are similar to the ones released by some plants under threat. We also confirmed the presence of a micro-organism, which we have temporarily called $gts_wind_creatures$, that may be controlling the wind."

  gts_astral_rift.2755.desc: "We provided the $gts_wind_creatures$ with a large amount of $gts_giantess_fluid$ and alloy debris. These abrasives are light enough to be carried away by individual air currents, but powerful enough to quickly cut off large chunks of foot gunk.\n\nA current of air quickly used these alloy debris to tear apart a cluster of yellow $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ hiding in a nearby crack.\n\nThe $gts_wind_creatures$ continued to distribute the alloy cuttings more widely among themselves. The fierce winds began to attack the foot gunk valleys, targeting the spore-spouting  $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ in a coordinated decapitation bombing.\n\nPerhaps to show their gratitude, a gust of wind delivered a bundle of fluffy 'floating eggs' to us. With these, we can cultivate our own '$gts_wind_creatures$' to bring this highly adapted airflow to our selected colonies, which are adapted to the environment under the giantess’s feet and use $gts_giantess_fluid$."

  gts_astral_rift.2760.desc: "We scattered a large amount of $gts_giantess_fluid$ as nutrients on the planet's surface and introduced new wind-resistant plants to the richer foot gunk mountains. Then, the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ was able to spread large amounts of spores on the weathered foot gunk soil of the plants.\n\nThe existing $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ population has been growing in size and resilience. Over time, the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ will spread across the entire surface of the insole, depriving the $gts_wind_creatures$ of their breeding grounds-and without question, the very source of the wind, the giantess's slight foot movements, are too violent for the reproduction process of these gales.\n\nThe nodes of the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ are filled with newfound strength, and messages of gratitude are being transmitted along its hyphal network.\n\nA previously undiscovered specimen of $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ then sprouted from the foot gunk near us. Its bulbous cavity is filled with a high concentration of foreign gas. We believe that cultivating these 'foam balls' will help us produce this valuable resource."

However, we finally reached an agreement between the two species.\n\nAs long as they do not interfere with the existing spore populations, the $gts_wind_creatures$ will be allowed to hunt and reproduce in designated areas on the planet's surface. At the same time, the hive mind of the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ is given equal space, where it can spread its spores without fear, accommodating countless other species under its protective network.\n\nUnder this arrangement, this unique ecosystem under the giantess's foot has new opportunities for prosperity.

As the corrosive $gts_giantess_fluid$ spreads, the $gts_wind_creatures$ dissolve into dust, and the $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ also withers and turns black.
