  civic_gts_cixiaogui: "Extraterrestrial Prank"
  civic_gts_cixiaogui_desc: "This nation thoroughly enjoys the thrill of toying with primitive civilizations. Even though such pranks terrify other space empires, they remain unfazed."

  civic_gts_cixiaogui_effects: "Prohibits the use of §YNo Interference§! and §YLimited Interference§! observation policies.\nUnlocks several unique native espionage operations.\nAble to plant the seeds of civilization on uncolonized habitable planets through §Yplanetary decisions§!."
  operation_gts_close_observation: "Prank - Close Observation"
  operation_gts_close_observation_desc: "Our researchers and spies, after undergoing adjustments in size and appearance, will infiltrate various sectors of this civilization for a short-term operation lasting three years. By masquerading as students, corporate employees, researchers, etc., they can more closely observe this pre-space civilization's natives, making certain tasks smoother to execute."

  operation_gts_close_observation_on_success: "Gain research points for 12 months and increase infiltration level by 20 points after three years."
  operation_gts_XP_guide: "Prank - Kink Guidance"
  operation_gts_XP_guide_desc: "Through bribing creators, infiltrating censorship bureaus, launching information wars, and various other means, we will manipulate the native culture market, making the primitive natives yearn for the 'possible existence' of giantess civilizations."

  operation_gts_XP_guide_on_success: "Gain cohesion for 12 months, with a small chance of the 'Brilliant Artist' event upon mission completion."
  operation_gts_kidnap: "Prank - Kidnap Research"
  operation_gts_kidnap_desc: "In this civilization, we shall select robust individuals meeting our needs, taking them away from primitive ignorance and hardship. In exchange, they must dedicate their entire beings to our research and other requirements."

  operation_gts_kidnap_on_success: "Slight increase in native awakening, consume 1 native pop, receive minor research and art boosts."
  operation_gts_set_abnormal: "Prank - Create Chaos"
  operation_gts_set_abnormal_desc: "We will discreetly create chaos on this planet, such as giving native girls 'mysterious' shrink devices or shrinking native males liked by numerous females. Observing their reactions allows us to gather fascinating research data."

  operation_gts_set_abnormal_on_success: "Increase native awakening, consume 2 native pops, decrease social stability, gain substantial sociology points."
  operation_gts_miracle_fall: "Prank - Descend a Miracle"
  operation_gts_miracle_fall_desc: "We will have agents with giantess appearances directly approach native society, creating appropriate destruction, letting as many natives as possible tremble in their shadow and witness the power and allure of a giantess."

  operation_gts_miracle_fall_on_success: "Dramatically increase native awakening, consume 3 native pops, cause destruction on the planet, and create several ruin tiles."
  gts_seeds_planeted: "Species of Lust"

  gts_seeds_planeted_desc: "The native civilization on this planet might one day realize they didn't originate from their home star but will never recognize their true origin as the secretions of a researcher pleasing themselves."
  gts_good_comic: "Best-Selling Native Artwork"
  gts_shock_comic_writer: "Loss of Artist"
  gts_good_comic_writer: "Genius Artist"
  gts_pre_ftl_bangjia: "Study Native Pop"

  gts_pre_ftl_chaos: "Natives in Chaos"
  decision_gts_civ_seeds: "Sow Seeds of Civilization"
  decision_gts_civ_seeds_desc: "Description"
  decision_gts_civ_seeds_effects_custom: "A new stone-age native civilization will appear on this planet."

  mission_gts_specimen_collection: "Active Capture"
  mission_gts_specimen_collection_desc: "We will gradually help the small natives on this planet emerge from the seas of ignorance, backwardness, and class oppression. In return, they must surrender their bodies and minds for our close study."
  mission_gts_native_indoctrination: "XP Guidance"

  mission_gts_native_indoctrination_desc: "By sponsoring native artists and writers, bribing cultural censorship departments, launching information warfare, and replacing web resources, we will subtly guide this species' kink development, steering them towards adoring and venerating giantesses."
  gts_civ_trick.10.name: "Infiltration Mission Begins"
  gts_civ_trick.10.desc: "Our short-term infiltration deployment on the target planet is complete. After brief training, young agents and scientists with forged identities have infiltrated local educational and corporate institutions. In the coming three years, they will sever contact with the observation station, using the established espionage network and supplied resources to investigate the native civilization's society, to be received by us three years later."

  gts_civ_trick.10.a: "Wish them luck"
  gts_civ_trick.11.name: "Infiltration Mission Ends"
  gts_civ_trick.11.desc: "Our short-term infiltration mission on the target planet is complete. Disguised as students or employees, our agents and scientists successfully destroyed their identities and returned safely to the observation station as this native civilization's education and work cycles ended. Besides shrinking natives to avoid exposure, some agents and scientists developed affection towards natives, used shrink technology, and brought them to the station. Such behavior faced criticism and disciplinary action after collective deliberation."

  gts_civ_trick.11.a: "Alright"
  gts_civ_trick.12.name: "XP Guidance Success"
  gts_civ_trick.12.desc: "Our mission to guide kinks on the target planet is complete. Our generous sponsorship and the translation of our cultural works nurtured a batch of loyal giantess culture enthusiasts. The creators’ community already formed respective groups. Though it's still early for them to fully grasp the allure of extraterrestrial giantesses, we've sown seeds in this civilization's cultural soil."

  gts_civ_trick.12.a: "Alright"
  gts_civ_trick.13.name: "Gifted Native Artist"
  gts_civ_trick.13.desc: "Our XP guidance activity yielded an unexpected outcome: the observation station reported a rising star in the native creators’ community, whose imagination and creation surpass others, with works appreciable by us. We should capitalize on this genius’s talents."
  gts_civ_trick.13.a: "Secretly fund this artist"

  gts_civ_trick.13.b: "Bring them up here for personal training!"
  gts_civ_trick.14.name: "Startled Artist"
  gts_civ_trick.14.desc: "Our understanding of this civilization is insufficient. The artist we kidnapped was greatly intimidated by the alien space civilization, and our tutoring was counterproductive. After returning home, they became excessively passionate about the extraterrestrial giantess civilization, forming radical political factions instead of continuing to create, as the native government unsurprisingly suppressed them."

  gts_civ_trick.14.a: "Regrettable..."
  gts_civ_trick.15.name: "Indoctrination Success"
  gts_civ_trick.15.desc: "Our nurturing of this artist was successful. Though overly advanced technology and real alien giantesses initially caused much fuss, they ultimately completed our art education. After training, they applied to join our empire and were approved, surely injecting fresh blood into our artistic endeavors."

  gts_civ_trick.15.a: "Amazing!"
  gts_civ_trick.16.name: "Kidnapping Success"
  gts_civ_trick.16.desc: "Our plan completed smoothly. Several native pops were secretly taken; after their initial panic, they gradually accepted their new care. As compensation for escaping primitive society, they will be dispatched to various research and art venues in our country to serve diverse roles."

  gts_civ_trick.16.a: "Very good"
  gts_civ_trick.17.name: "Create Anomaly"
  gts_civ_trick.17.desc: "Our plan to create anomalies in native civilization succeeded. Several long-observed native girls received \"mysterious\" package deliveries – shrink guns monitored by us. Moreover, many observed male natives were shrunk and \"inadvertently\" discovered by female friends or relatives. These actions have had initial effects on native society; our observation station will continue close monitoring."

  gts_civ_trick.17.a: "Very good"
  gts_civ_trick.18.name: "Descend Miracle"
  gts_civ_trick.18.desc: "Our action to descend a miracle upon natives was hugely successful. Genetically edited agents appeared in major native cities, causing destruction and amusement. Although the mission inevitably caused casualties and property loss, the overwhelming power and captivating beauty of the giantess left survivors with profound impressions, predictably marking a significant chapter in their history."

  gts_civ_trick.18.a: "Very good"
  gts_civ_trick.19.name: "Divine Mandate"
  gts_civ_trick.19.desc: "In spreading kinks, we found a native self-relying to assist our infiltration propaganda, over-glorifying giantesses, even establishing a religion."

  gts_civ_trick.19.a: "This is crazy"
  gts_civ_trick.20.name: "Divine Right"
  gts_civ_trick.20.desc: "Yet, in preaching, as if truly blessed by a deity, they rapidly grew into a demi-giantess! Though not comparable to our size, leveraging size and faith, they began causing rampant destruction on the planet, leaving local tinies terrified daily."

  gts_civ_trick.20.a: "Time for a true deity to save this civilization"
  gts_civ_trick.21.name: "Divine Right"
  gts_civ_trick.21.desc: "The self-proclaimed invincible giantess nun cowered upon witnessing our landing. We attempted communication with this demi-giantess, yet she seemed dazed by reality... Finally, using 50 energy credits, our interrogation officer bought her KFC, persuading the petite demi-giantess to engage more with us. This lively creature flitting among our citizens' feet has brightened our empire’s mood."

  gts_civ_trick.21.a: "Yes, all tinies shall face justice eventually"
  gts_civ_trick.22.name: "Cowardly Demi-Giantess Adapts"
  gts_civ_trick.22.desc: "Enormous nuns mocked their civilization in disdain, indulging in abuse of the tinies. Our spies quickly captured her, slipping her into stockings. She rested after struggling, enamored with the foot's charm, frequently intruding into the personnel's stockings, causing disruption – being larger than cleaners."
  gts_civ_trick.22.a: "Integrate this demi-giantess into our civilization"
