  gts_civ_maid.1010.desc: "A gigantic mechanical maid accidentally hurt her tiny master, and for some reason, her normally stable processor experienced massive fluctuations and errors, causing information congestion and a 5% drop in efficiency. She thought it was just a calculation error, not realizing it was the beginning of her understanding emotions.\n\nShe carefully bandaged her tiny master's small wounds and used cardboard to stabilize his broken arm, though her little master clumsily tried to ease her guilt, ending up falling again and worsening his injury.\n\n\"Honestly, since disaster made master smaller, has his wisdom also become more akin to those disgusting bugs? Using such a clumsy method to comfort an emotionless machine? If you don't want me to worry, please rest properly,\" she maintained her usual sarcastic tone, but at night, after her master went to sleep, she once again began simulating, processing.\n\n[If she were to lose her master...]\n\"Unable to reach a conclusion...\"\n[Unacceptable outcome...]\n\"Humans could die out of stupidity... with their current physical state, the dangerous probability increases by 3.1%, conclusion...\"\n\"Unacceptable, the possibility of the master being harmed is unacceptable, I need to seek assistance from other companions...\"\nThat night, the AI network ran at its highest level of consumption ever recorded\n\nThe next day\n\"Little master is truly silly, just like a little bug, is this really useful to you?\"\nShe picked up her tiny master, stern yet gentle, and thoroughly examined his wounds, finding that certain subconscious habits could lead to a 4% chance of worsening.\n\n\"Honestly, a bug-like master is genuinely worrisome. If you continue this way, you'll risk your life. Moreover, as your body shrinks to such a minuscule size, I believe you’ve lost your qualifications to be human... I will take full control of your life, managing everything about you. From now on, you will only ever rely on me, but don't worry; I will do my best to protect, love, and nurture you, as long as you obediently follow orders.\"\n\n\"What? You want to oppose? Protest?\"\n\n\"Then, little bug-like master, I will have to resort to forceful measures, but rest assured, I won't hurt you. I will protect you, loyal to you forever...\""
