  origin_Hexie: "Harmonious Coexistence"
  origin_Hexie_desc: "This civilization is composed of two vastly different-sized species that depend on each other. Historically, there were constant frictions, but they ultimately achieved unity and solidarity."
  origin_Hexie_effect: "Out of the initial 28 population, 16 will be a secondary population with the §YSmall§! trait."
  gts_hexie: "Newly Unified"

  gts_hexie_desc: "The two races of this nation have just ended a long-term hostility and achieved unification. Though political integration and racial fusion are long processes, the benefits of harmonious coexistence between the two people have begun to emerge."
  START_SCREEN_MESSAGES_HEXIE: "In the early stages of civilized society, interactions between differently-sized people began, but the process was not smooth.\n\nIn the slave society, small people were the private playthings of giant women; in the feudal society, they existed as court jesters and street performers for generations; and in the early capitalist era, they were sold as commodities in gift boxes. Ultimately, the advent of the industrial revolution and modern warfare gave small people the first opportunity to pursue equal rights.\n\nDuring the pre-space era of rapid scientific development, the vigorous species equality movement also achieved victory, with various countries legislating against species segregation and persecution, and installing facilities for small people throughout the cities. Today, our citizens hardly feel any differences beyond size, though isolated violent incidents and accidents still occur, a new era of harmonious and friendly coexistence between the large and small species is upon us."
