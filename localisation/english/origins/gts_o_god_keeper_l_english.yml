  gts_god_keeper.5013.title: "Yaorong Has Returned"
  gts_god_keeper.5013.desc: "Gods are immortal, and the sight before you undoubtedly proves that. At the towering Mother Goddess statue in the capital, millions of devout followers gather, regardless of size, all chanting hymns in praise of the goddess. The hymns are divine and majestic, the lyrics solemn and respectful, with more and more followers spontaneously joining this great sacrifice to call back their goddess. The sacrifice has been ongoing for half a day, and under your perception, endless energy is gradually boiling up from hyperspace. The surrounding planets seem to shift their orbits under this force. It is the sacrifice of the believers that have locked onto the coordinates in reality, and your gaze that has anchored Yaorong's will. The surrounding power suddenly subsides after reaching its peak, and for a moment, the space next to the capital's homeworld quietly shatters. A maiden's pale hands reach out from hyperspace, using what seems to be gentle but unstoppable force, and creates a narrow rift in space almost as wide as the solar system. Yaorong, your daughter, emerges slowly in a naked, childlike posture, and the stars light up again as the empire welcomes back their mother goddess. Yaorong's eyes, as brilliant as gold and expansive enough to hold countless empire homeworlds, instantly lock onto your location. Her red lips slightly part:\n“§P Father, I have returned!§!”"
  gts_god_keeper.5013.option: "§Y Welcome back.§!"
  gts_god_keeper.5014.title: "Physiological Needs"
gts_god_keeper.5014.desc: "§PIs it here?§! \nThe maiden's exquisite face flushed with a touch of crimson, making her look exceptionally beautiful... But that is only if the person seeing Yaorong can ignore her magnificent body that could eclipse the sky. She once crushed the grand fleets of the stagnated holy authority with her own body, and also humbly lowered her proud head in front of you, wagging her tail like a little dog. But whether called a [Star Destroyer] or a dog-like child in front of you, she was just a girl who was a little larger than usual.\nShe would reveal an arrogant and domineering side in front of enemies, but also show her daughterly gentleness and wilfulness to you, while in the “unmanned” environment, she would reveal a bit of her nature.\nThe luxurious black dress slowly slid down, revealing Yaorong's flawlessly perfect body to the cosmos. Her eyes, as bright as stars, flashed a hint of hesitation and shame, but the restlessness emanating from within her body made her cast aside these useless emotions.\nHer slender fingers lightly touched the planet hovering near Yaorong’s lower body. This action, simply her daughter wanting to adjust her physiological condition, brought a disaster comparable to the end of days to the civilization on this planet.\n............\nMany natural wonders existed on this planet. In the early days of the civilization, these vast rivers nurtured the intelligent life that would come to dominate the world. They were an advanced civilization that knew gratitude and respected the environment, and even before they had built a FTL engine, they had already begun to embrace environmental protection on their homeworld. They cherished the natural environment that had nurtured their civilization even more than they yearned for the stars.\nContinuous milky-white pillars of jade fell unreasonably on the planet. Yaorong's simple action of fixing the planet in place to make her physiological activity more comfortable had already killed tens of millions of lifeforms. The instigator of this terrible act did not even realize the fragility and insignificance of the life on this planet, which was as humble as dust and ants under her fingertips... Perhaps she knew, but would she really care?\nAfter all, this was not just pure amusement for her, but rather she was carrying out your orders... Although the process was not what you intended, Yaorong believed that as long as the result was good, her father would not blame her.\n“§PHmm, Father's requirements seem to be quite specific...§!” After completing the task of fixing the planet, which was nothing short of a miracle for an alien civilization, Yaorong finally remembered the instructions you had given her. This was an execution, and for Yaorong, such an execution required, in addition to \"modifying the planet,\" making the opposing empire's leaders realize how foolish they had been to oppose the empire.\nYan had ruled this planet for decades. Although he would not call himself a revitalizing leader, he believed he had at least not failed the legacy left by his ancestors. He was quite satisfied with his way of governing-- until he witnessed the crushing of the planet's largest mountain range into a smudge between the fingers of the young girl, and the river that had been the beginning of their civilization, being cleaved in two....\nBut that was not the end. Even tens of millions of meters away, Yan could clearly hear the words of the perpetrator of these calamities. She seemed to simply be carrying out an order. The billions of lives on this planet were not nearly as important as that order.\nJust as Yan was about to give the order for evacuation, Yaorong’s voice came again.\n“§PFound you...leader of the empire.§!”\nThe girl's voice was emotionless, with no hint of anger or ridicule, and aside from the barely noticeable blush that Yan could not see, Yaorong's expression was as indifferent as when she patrolled the empire's borders.\nHowever, in Yan's eyes, he was instantly imprisoned in a world of pink without any means of resisting. It did not take long for him to realize that what had been obscuring the sun was the naked lower body of the maiden before him.\nTo a species that had ventured into the cosmos and knew of the concept of shame, Yaorong’s action was nothing short of an insult-arrogantly displaying one’s genitals, even threatening to urinate on them. Yet, she cared absolutely nothing. After all, to Yaorong, this small rocky planet with billions of inhabitants was too tiny, not even enough to be considered parasites on her body.\nBut even knowing resistance was impossible and that the empire’s main fleet had already been devoured by Yaorong as a snack, when Yaorong flushed and aimed her urethra at the planet, which had already ceased all rotation and revolution, they still made futile attempts at resistance.\nWhile Yaorong was still flexing her lower body, trying to prevent the planet from being destroyed too early by her biological processes, they finally launched their counterattack.\nThe (opposing empire name) no longer had any starbases or shipyards, nor did they have spaceships equipped with FTL engines. In fact, they could not even muster a single corvette, and could only mount tactical nuclear warheads on \"primitive\" fighters in a futile gesture of resistance.\nThe first wave of attacks saw hundreds of fighters take off, yet the closer they got to Yaorong's lower body, the more they felt their insignificance. The folds of Yaorong's lower body were far wider than the deepest trench on this planet, and the valley between her thighs was tens of thousands of meters wide, so much so that even a battleship could probably fit there, let alone those fighters barely escaping the atmosphere.\nAfter witnessing such \"beauty\" as if it were a divine miracle, the final act of futile resistance had arrived -- the fighters, moving slower than snails, were clear as day to Yaorong. They had survived until now simply because the girl had become playful and wanted to see what sort of feeling she would get from the desperate struggle of such a weak civilization.\nFinally, the ultimate weapons of the atomic age fulfilled its purpose, despite that the planet-shattering weapons' final target being the urethra of a young girl. There was no glory in that, nor did they know if their do-or-die attack had even worked in the smoke-filled scene.\nYaorong, who was thinking about where to begin her release, finally felt the futile resistance of this civilization. While atomic weapons could not even scratch Yaorong's scales, it was a different matter if they were to explode on a sensitive spot like her urethra.\n“§PHmm… is that all?§!”\nThe greatest yield of atomic weapons that the fighters could carry merely resulted in a tickling sensation to Yaorong. And this was despite her clenching her lower body, baring her clitoris and urethra as if inviting the attacks of the microscopic beings.\n“§PThis sensation isn't enough…!§!”\nThe girl's murmur was still soft, but her actions were a perfect display of brutality. Her verdant fingers once again pressed down on the surface of the planet, but this time it was different from the previous action of stopping the planet-- what she was doing was digging up the city complexes built on the planet.\nYan watched this scene unfold in utter desperation. He had witnessed the do-or-die resistance and realized that not only had the nuclear weapons failed to hurt the monstrous being who had trapped him, but it had even incited her to play more. She had even lifted a whole continental shelf with her hand, placing it next to her lower body!\nHe wanted to roar, but how could the monster who obscured the sky possibly care about screams from someone who was less than a louse; he wanted to resist, but his arms and legs were already restrained on this pink continent; he wanted to end his life, unable to stand by and watch his people being subjected to such a humiliating massacre... But even death was at the mercy of the monster.\nAn entire continental shelf only occupied about a quarter of Yaorong's palm. And the numerous high rises on top of it and the people living at the surface became even more insignificant. But even though these civilizations were as insignificant as microbes, they still chose to resist Yaorong's humiliating massacre.\nLand-based nuclear missiles launched one after another. This was a do-or-die counterattack, the most dazzling display of a dying civilization. Whether it was out of a twisted sense of humor or because she actually wanted to experience what it would be like, Yaorong leaned forward again, using her urethra to steadily receive this desperate act of resistance.\n“§POoh…§!”\nDifferent from the tactical nuclear bombs carried by the fighters, these land-based strategic nuclear missiles were originally designed for deterrence. Under normal conditions, they could destroy even a battleship with a direct hit, but even such a powerful weapon, exploding at the girl's urethra only brought...\nYaorong finally relaxed, no longer forcefully holding back her body, letting golden urine pour out like the cataclysmic flood described in the Bible. Of course, before taking such relieving action, the little dragon had already retracted her hand, as she had other plans for the “continent” in her hands.\nOther than the first strategic nuclear missile, which successfully gave Yaorong a strange sensation, the second and the following strategic nuclear missiles that were about to hit Yaorong were completely destroyed by her urine. The terrifying weapons that could destroy a city or even a battleship was even weaker than the urine that the maiden released. The nuclear weapons that could have killed hundreds of thousands or millions of people could only spark a few lights in front of Yaorong's urine.\nHot, golden liquid fell from the sky. That was the result of a young girl's physiological need. That was but an act of victory.\nYan witnessed the highest peak of the planet, a mountain called sacred, melt away in the torrent of golden urine. The sacred snow cap and majestic mountain melted like butter in the maiden's waste liquid. Next was the great river, which flowed between the many cities and had always been referred to by this civilization as their mother river. However, the mother river that they had tried to protect with all their strength, along with the city complexes built around it, was also drowned in the golden flood of destruction; Whether it was the ecological garden that had nurtured ancient flora and fauna or the ecological forest that had long since become a nature reserve, their continued existence was perhaps only to make Yaorong feel more fulfilled and superior towards these weaklings as she urinated.\nYan closed his eyes in despair. He knew that his friends, his embraces, his planet, his civilization... had all disappeared completely. The monster who had trapped him inside her lower body; one of her physiological behaviors alone was enough to destroy the evolutionary path of a civilization… and not a single trace of shame could be discerned from her, as if the 6 billion people who had died under her urine were no more significant to her than a casual meal!\n“§PAh… it’s over…!§!”\nYaorong did not let out any lewd sound of pleasure. Despite knowing that she was now the only one left in this star system and the insignificant being parasitic on her lower body, the sense of “modesty” let her maintain her usual behavior. \n“§PIs this the last spark left of their civilization?§!”\nYaorong’s voice was still flat; and under the gaze of her golden eyes, the remaining civilization in the city was already kneeling on the ground in despair. But Yaorong couldn't hear it, or wouldn't pay attention even if she could. Her only thought now was to use that continental shelf, which was barely enough to be considered tissue paper, to wipe off the residual urine from her urethra.\n“§PIt’s...quite useful.§!”\nThe continental shelf with over 500 million people, hundreds of giant city settlements, and a complete terrain was now being used as a tissue paper to wipe the lower body of the maiden. The intelligent life on the continental shelf was completely annihilated at the moment of direct contact with Yaorong’s tender flesh, leaving behind only their corpses and their once magnificent cities being rubbed repeatedly against the maiden's urethra... \n“§PHopefully father won’t blame me…!§!”\nLooking at the golden, ammonia-smelling planet, Yaorong's face was still flushed -- she didn't care about any destruction that might result from her physiological needs. However, she cared about your opinion, a lot! And in fact, if you told her firsthand to not act in that way, she would certainly follow right away... even if she had some minor grievances in her mind.\nFinally, after re-dressing, Yaorong finally remembered the order you had given her -- to make sure that the leaders of the opposing empire knew what their faults were. However, the little one frowned and averted her gaze after looking at the planet completely taken over by her own urine. She knew she was going to get a scolding if she were to show this current result to you.\nFortunately, Yaorong finally remembered that she had somewhat finished what you had given her before the execution.\n“§POh, I almost forgot about you, you poor thing. You must hate me very much, given how the world in which you have lived for generations has simply disappeared. But don’t worry, you can soon join them.§!”\nYaorong's scoff finally broke Yan's last line of defense... but now he could only live on barely under Yaorong’s genitals, surviving off of the scraps of the ruined cities and the urine of Yaorong. \nWill he succeed in his vengeance?\nOr will he become an unremarkable louse on Yaorong’s body?\nYaorong didn't care. She had simply finished the task given to her and solved her physiological needs -- and as for the 6.5 billion lives who had died under her urine... Yaorong had never cared from the beginning.

gts_god_keeper.5600.title: "The Beginning"
gts_god_keeper.5600.desc: "Those bright golden eyes were more dazzling than a star, and yet, the owner of the eyes looked upon them with affection and tenderness… the people who were prepared at the starbase, ready to enter the God's body, were now too afraid to look at the God they had served and worshipped for half their lives.\n\n§P“Are you truly willing to go? Once you are in, there’s no turning back. Your fate will be to remain in my body forever.”§!\n\n§P“Until now, you still have a chance... I do not mind keeping you inside me, but I do also not think that what awaits you in my body is the paradise you are imagining.”§!\n\n“... I offer my flesh and blood to our great God, the mother and savior of our race, and let her rule over the entire cosmos by supreme destiny!”\n\nYaorong sighed. She did not particularly like these overly zealous followers. In her values, as their God, her role was to protect these insignificant followers as well as to fulfill their wishes that were not too extreme.\n\nTo be honest, conquering enemy planets was simple; extinguishing a star or even devouring a star wasn't too difficult either; but this group of people wanted to explore her body--- actually, even the surface would have been fine. If she were to shrink them, even a single wrinkle on her body would have been large enough to entertain them for a lifetime. But if it was inside... given Yaorong’s size, it is probably larger than any galaxy they had seen. If a stupid science ship were to make the mistake of entering her, it would not only face the dangers from the immune system but would also be lost forever in the complex network of cavities. Just thinking about those fanatic followers traversing her body fluids daily, worshiping in the soft cavities, and caressing her flesh made Yaorong shudder. A strange emotion sprouted inside her and, she suddenly did not want to agree to those apparently \"not too extreme wishes\".\n\nThe small lives in the starbase noticed that something was off with their god. Panic spread immediately as everyone knelt down, anxiously praising the greatness of their god, afraid that she would withdraw her divine grace.\n\nYaorong looked at the starbase. The giant base that her father called “Citadel” could now fit easily between her teeth. And the largest colony ships that those little guys had were at most comparable to the ion cannons on a fortress.\n\nSuch tiny colony ships wanted to explore her body……\n\n“Compatriots! The time has come for His Majesty and God to test us! For the sake of God’s safety, how can we forsake our duties?”\n\nThe voice of a little guy was quite impassioned, it would seem that the guy was the leader among them. But the statement he made put a sense of helplessness in Yaorong – what does it mean “for the sake of God’s safety” ? What danger could she possibly be in? Even the Stars were nothing more than a snack to her.\n\nEven so, Yaorong had no intention of speaking out against his statement. Watching them make a ruckus was a lot of fun. At least, when she was not spending time with her sister looking for sources of fun (and food), or teasing her father, these followers who viewed her as their mother were a source of amusement to her."

gts_god_keeper.5601.title: "The Beginning"
gts_god_keeper.5601.desc: "§P“Well then…I’m ready, my little ones.”§!\n\nYaorong leaned slightly forward with her face closer to the small “Citadel”. This act would have normally made the little guys inside the giant fortress that could barely fit into her teeth panic--at least it did when she was little. But the little guys did not fear her anymore.\n\nYaorong opened her mouth.\n\nThe red and plump lips would have been a beautiful thing worth kissing, but that was under a normal scale. The wrinkling of Yaorong’s lips in the colony ship’s view was enough to completely contain them, while the pinkness within the lips, the world larger than a gas giant--no, even larger than a star, was the origin of their endless journey.\n\nThe maiden’s mouth remained open. However, while the colony ships were still on their way to the seemingly bottomless abyss, Yaorong’s white teeth and canines were covered in overflowing saliva – her unconscious bodily secretion, a drop of which could contain a small asteroid.\n\nSome curious people looked out.\n\nIt was a vast, boundless crimson world. On the colony ship display, they could even observe the “remains” on Yaorong’s tongue and teeth. Of course, even “remains” was only applicable when viewed from the perspective of humankind. The remains of starships, parts of giant structures’ framework, the mantle or parts of the core of planets… These things, after the first chewing, would have but a few extremely small remains left in the maiden’s mouth. For Yaorong, this was not even worth her attention. Yet, the scale of these remains were comparable to their special colony ship.\n\nFor Yarong's followers, the strength of their God was beyond question. They only needed to pray with all their heart and offer their bones and blood to her. But when they truly received her grace, being allowed to survive inside her body, they truly understood what kind of existence their God was.\n\nYaorong, whose mouth was open like a dog’s, quickly closed it after the little guys' colony ship entered her body. After confirming that her sister, father, and the little shapeshifter that she was raising were not around watching her embarrassing actions, the little dragon could finally relax.\n\nSince her embarrassing moment has not been discovered, then everything was fine – could those little guys cause chaos in her body?"

gts_god_keeper.5602.title: "The Gastric Colony"
gts_god_keeper.5602.desc: "Yaorong’s body was indeed more vast and grand than some ordinary star systems, but that doesn’t mean that the space in her body was infinite. But this also meant that if the small ship did not become wreckage in her body, they may be able to completely explore her insides for months or even years.\n\nAfter thinking about this possibility, the little dragon forced herself to cast out the thought. Though they were unlikely to try to harm her, just thinking about their actions in her body made her…\n\n.....\n\nAfter a few months, this colony fleet had finally passed through the maiden’s mouth, through the long, dark abyss-like void, and finally arrived at the first station of divine grace.\n\nThe pinkish world, which occupied everyone’s sight, was so enormous and magnificent that even with the help of special hardware, they might not be able to fully explore in their lifetime. Just as what the then young God once teased her emperor father, 'A single wrinkle on my body would be enough to contain you all, can’t you be nicer to me!'.\n\nLooking at it now, either the God was still very young back then and had not fully grown up yet, or her concept of “people” and “civilizations” were vastly different.\n\nThey never expected that the distance from her esophagus to her pylorus would be so long and dangerous. The world, which was a mix of pink and red, was as grand as the legendary heavenly court… that's right, all the mythologies that came from the [Player Empire] came from her. The creator of mythologies was naturally grander countless times compared to its believers.\n\nThey decided to establish a colony here.\n\nThey only needed a small alcove in the gastric mucosa in the God’s belly to establish a decent colony. They could even create a unique technology tree, different from the one outside of Yaorong's body, through the understanding and analysis of her body. \n\nIf… they could survive in this environment, much more dangerous than outer space.\n\nAfter all, Yaorong’s gastric acid alone was enough to dissolve the most powerful Paradox Titan-class warship of a Fallen Empire into elementary particles, and the force generated by a single contraction and dilation of her stomach was comparable to multiple “matter decompressors”. But this came as a benefit to their surroundings. As long as they could survive here, they could progress much easier depending on the resources that the God had consumed."

gts_god_keeper.5603.title: "Madness and Confusion - The Beginning"
gts_god_keeper.5603.desc: "As always, Ivan lay in this vast crimson world that was beyond his capacity to explore in his life. It was the body of their most revered, most respected God. A single wrinkle in her belly was enormous enough to build multiple districts in.\n\n“Indeed worthy of our God…”\n\nAt the very same moment that Ivan sighed, a dreadful humming echoed, but to him and the other parasites housed inside Yaorong’s belly, this terrifying sound did not mean a disaster-rather the opposite. The sound was a sign that their God was simply starting to eat.\n\nAnd their God beginning to eat also meant that their resources for the next few months or even years would be secured. While picking up the remains that have been almost, completely, digested from the folds inside God was indeed an option, nothing beat snatching the food from the God’s mouth-assisting the God’s digestion was one of their missions, after all!\n\nThe crimson world began to shake. Soon after, pieces of planets of unimaginable sizes began to fall from the cardia, but inside Yaorong’s liquids they merely rippled. Of course, this was when compared to Yaorong’s entire stomach. In Ivan’s perspective, the waves produced by the falling planet fragments were one of the most magnificent sceneries he had ever laid eyes upon.\n\n“Compatriots! It’s time to gather resources!”\n\nIvan, as a scout, sent out the message. But this time, the commotion was so overwhelming, that even those in charge of collecting resources who did not get the message would have arrived quickly. For him, for now, all he had to do was marvel at this “beauty”.\n\nWith the specialized equipment, Ivan saw the planet fragments, or, rather, the continental shelves gradually dissolving in Yaorong’s gastric fluids. He wasn't very clear about it. Though he had seen this not just once, he didn't dare ask his God what kind of strange things she ate--was it reasonable for him to pat the crimson surface and ask whether his God had eaten yet?. \n\n“A relatively complete city was found with standard industrial districts… Did God eat a planet from the enemy?”\n\nSwallowing an entire planet may seem like a terrifying gesture, but to a being whose internal body is capable of forming an independent ecology, and whose body can be larger than a star in times of need, a habitable planet was probably the same as a candy or a small bread.\n\nTheir empire had been in constant war. As the princess and guardian god of the empire, Yaorong was not only the most terrifying deterrent, but also the greatest weapon. Aside from the Fallen Empire’s main fleets, no fleet had ever stopped her pace. And on the topic of planets from opposing empires…\n\nLooking at the planet fragments bathing in the tumultuous gastric fluids, Ivan felt a tinge of pity for those people. Excluding the planetary defense forces, most of these people probably did not deserve to die. But there was no alternative. They had foolishly chosen to start a war with their empire, and therefore they deserved their fate.\n\nThere were three landing strategies for the Empire. The first one was to have super-heavy mobile fortresses lead the way, followed by mobile construction crews, and then powerful psionics gifted by God. The former ensured the stability of the advance, and the latter was in charge of the killing. This method had the least destruction. The second landing strategy involved Yaorong, or her sister, shrinking themself down and playing on the planet--usually at sizes ranging from 10 kilometers to 100 kilometers. The damage caused by the two princesses when they “played” was often second only to launching the Empire’s “Colossus” on the planet. \n\nAnd the third landing was the cruelest. The God, at her normal size, would directly devour the enemy planet. Or… Ivan had heard of a particularly cruel execution that their God had enacted. There was once a country called 'Dragon Is Very Strong, Poisonous Rock Man', which insulted their empire. Months after their war began, the God stepped foot into the same system used by her coworkers. \n\nAfter capturing their guardian dragon, the capital was crushed under God’s toes, and even the remaining residue was licked clean by God’s younger sister. \n\nThis was the God they served and believed in. She showed her tenderness and strength to the citizens of the empire as much as she could. She showed her gentle and seductive side to her father, and showcased her terrifyingly arrogant and invincible power to the enemies of the empire.\n\nAt least… that was the situation now.\n\n............"

gts_god_keeper.5604.desc: "“The collector clusters and autonomous robots are in position.”\n\n“Roger that! This is definitely going to be a big haul! Blessings from our God!”\n\n“Acknowledged. This time, please refrain from getting overexcited again, causing the last batch of collectors to be lost in God's gastric juices. The collector you're linked with is not the last one coming back, do you remember!\"\n\nThe operator of the collectors was excited, but he didn’t realize that the only ones capable of responding to him were the soulless robots. In the few months after their settlement was established, the researchers among them discovered that the laws of physics within their God’s body were completely different from the outside. And the most fatal point was that regular communication devices had trouble performing information exchange. Though they were only a wrinkle away from the cardia, the FTL communication technology that the hyperlight civilizations were proud of could not communicate with Yaorong, and they could not even communicate with the others within her either…. But then again, for the little guys that acted as “probiotics” to freely explore Yaorong’s body was already the greatest grace they could have hoped for.\n\n“But… this place seems very familiar.”\n\nAs Ivan previously witnessed, the city and industrial districts were standard, almost the epitome of the standards of the Empire.\n\nSoon, the collector robots successfully delivered the first round of supplies. But in addition to the thousands of tons of resources, some strange things were also picked out by the sorters--in the past the strange things they found were usually lucky creatures that managed to avoid their God's chewing such as a Leviathan star-god beast to an origin species about to become an organic insight. It was safe to say that their God was not picky at all.\n\nBut this time, it was different. They found many pieces of paper soaked in blood with crimson letters scribbled on them.\n\n“I hereby offer my flesh and blood to our great Majesty, the mother of our race, our goddess and savior. Let her rule over the entire cosmos with her supreme destiny”.\n\nIt was a hymn praising Yaorong, and that much was obvious. But the question was… why would a letter of praise of such high level that was written in blood appear on a planet that their God had devoured? Did the followers of their God conquer the planet? But there have never been precedents of such things ever!\n\nHowever, there were things beyond the bloodstain praise that caused them confusion and shock. When the collector robots brought back the second batch of supplies, the bodies buried under the alloys with fanatical smiles on their faces were enough to send any devout believer into a panic.\n\nThey were their compatriots.\n\nAnd like them, they were all devout believers of their God."

gts_god_keeper.5605.desc: "The third round of supplies was brought back. But the staff preparing to receive the resources have already lost much of their courage to inspect it-although during their previous missions, there were times they encountered powerful monsters within the supplies such as a highly poisonous rock species in a state of feigned death. Such a powerful monster could have killed dozens in a single encounter, or even tear down the most powerful psionic in their ranks. But such existence would not cause them to feel any fear. After all, they were within God’s body, with God being with them-but the problem now lies with the forming of a terrifying hypothesis, an idea that was enough to shake their faith to its core.\n\n“We… should we take another look?”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, don't scare yourself...”\n\nThe sorters tremblingly lifted up the polymer covers that were sealed by the autonomous robots, revealing not high-quality ore but a small statue submerged under red ore.\n\nIt was a statue of their God, which was something that would never be present on a “conquered planet”.\n\nSilence once again shrouded this fold. They all thought of how God’s younger sister had gone mad before, as the former mother god transformed into a terrifying monster and burned the entire civilization into ashes under her feet.\n\n“We shouldn’t worry here, we should inform the relevant officials. What could… what could be our conclusions?”\n\n“Yes, let those bigwigs consider this!”\n\n“I agree!”\n\nJust as they were planning on handing this problem over to the leaders who established a divine kingdom in a fold of Yaorong's stomach, a booming sound that tore at their eardrums rang out again. Their experiences throughout the years told them that their God seemed to have eaten again-something that has never happened in the past few years!\n\nWhether it was the sorters, the operators of the collectors, or the watchman Ivan, all were knocked down to the ground by the booming sound. Luckily, their current world was Yaorong’s stomach, and the crimson ground beneath their feet was the gentlest and softest blanket in the world. None of the individuals would be crippled because of God’s eating habits.\n\nHowever, even if there were people who broke their arms or legs, they were not in anyone’s concern anymore. The attention of everyone was fixed on the cause of the booming sound. Very soon, they realized that they would need specialized tools, even if that means looking through astronomical distances, to get a glimpse at what was ingested by their God. And the ones with that tool are…\n\n“Ivan, please respond!”\n\n“…………”\n\n“Ivan!”\n\n“God… she has gone mad.”\n\nBeyond the gastric sea that stretched for several astronomical units, were the broken remnants of another planet.\n\nIt was the home of Ivan.\n\n……………………"

After all, it was only in this scale that she could communicate intimately with her father-and now, Yaorong’s most respected father was looking at his daughter at the small of her back like a lost and confused child.\n\n§Y“What are you talking about?”§!\n\nYaorong covered her mouth, forcibly swallowing the burp that almost came out. Though the little girl was always free-spirited and carefree, she still wanted to present herself as a lady in front of her father. Even though she knew that no matter what she did, her father would not treat her as a regular father would treat their daughter.\n\n§P“The small guys that voluntarily ‘sacrificed’ themselves earlier, what are your opinions on their behavior?”§!\n\nThe young girl spoke softly, while quietly hovering her fingers over her father’s head. Of course, this did not mean that she was threatening her father. Yaorong was just a bit playful and simply wanted him to feel her gentler side.\n\n§Y“Hmph-You… Yaorong, do you think I am easy to talk to?”§!\n\nThough his tone sounded like a scolding, he actually just wanted his daughter to tone down her playfulness. After all, even those who have been blessed by God, such as those exceptionally strong psionics, would be turned into a meat paste if Yaorong had poked at them seriously--even though he knew that Yaorong would never hurt him.\n\n§P“Yaorong believes that an interesting atmosphere is required before discussing a serious topic with Father, to prevent you from placing the importance of your weak empire over me.”§!\n\nThe soft touch of her skin always made people wish to lose themself in her. But her attempt to reveal her gentle and innocent nature by undressing wasn’t an attempt to “seduce” her father. Yaorong was more or less simply… wanting to receive her father’s attention.\n\n§P“Father, what are your views on those who sacrificed themselves?”§!\n\n§Y“What kind of view?”§!\n\nThe emperor of the empire, the supreme leader, shook his head with a wry smile after pushing away the finger that was hovering above him. As a political leader of the empire, the actions of these followers made him uneasy-a sacrifice that involved billions of manpower and two entire planets just to please his silly daughter? Was that reasonable? And as the spiritual leader of the Empire; and even as a child that was the holy son to this little baby dragon that served as the mother god of the empire, he could completely understand the “mad” actions they had performed.\n\nThe former mother goddess was no more than a thousand meters tall, and her power had to bow under the rules of the universe. And now, this little dragon that recognized him as her father had the power to rewrite the rules of the universe. Such power would always make people unconsciously surrender to that power and even become superstitious… but the sacrifice of billions of people and two planets was simply too much!\n\n§P“Mn!”§!\n\nHowever, compared to your heavy mood, Yaorong did not seem to pay as much attention to the things she had done earlier. To her, so-called serious topics were no more than everyday conversations with her father.\n\n§Y“They should have done it voluntarily.”§!\n\n§P“Of course they did it voluntarily, I have given those who were not so fanatical enough time to leave those two planets.”§!\n\n§Y“If it was voluntary, then why are you asking me, Yaorong?”§!\n\nThe fleshy ground beneath you started to shake. Such scenery spelled out your next fate-your daughter seemed to be planning on sitting up to have a proper discussion with her father. Of course, it was also possible that it was only at this moment that the little girl finally realized that it was rather indecent to have left her father on her back while she was being lazy on her bed."

But with your head still spinning, you had no time to admire your daughter's beautiful features. What you concerned yourself with was how you were able to fall from your daughter without dying...\n\n§P“Father…”§!\n\nThe little girl’s voice had slowed down, and become significantly more gentle. This was probably because the little girl knew that it was a bad thing to drop her father off her stomach, even if her father is unlikely to punish her over such “minor” matters.\n\n§Y“Mn…”§!\n\nBy the time you finally regained your composure, Yaorong's posture had turned wild - even when you had thought several minutes ago that the little girl had decided to shift you off of her before as her posture was too indecent and improper. \n\nYaorong, while embracing a pillow, leaned forward and sat cross-legged, with her bare feet restlessly curled up. The sight was very alluring, but the somewhat aggressive gaze from those golden vertical pupils would make anyone hesitate from any blasphemous ideas.\n\n§P“I do not intend to let them sacrifice themselves for me like the [Cult of Death.] Hmm… Do you remember the small guys who wanted to explore my body earlier?”§!\n\nYaorong chuckled softly, before opening her mouth before you.\n\nHer face, that had never been painted with rouge, was always extremely beautiful. Even the improper posture of opening her mouth was still enticing--fog began to dissipate from the maiden’s mouth, and the crimson-colored flesh walls were covered in sticky and smelly fluid that was flowing like a miniature waterfall.\n\n§P“They entered from here. Of course, their size was hundreds of thousands of times smaller than you… or was it one million or ten million times? You know I don’t care about such things.”§!\n\nThe maiden conveyed her voice using psionics, a gesture that did not require her to use her mouth - this allowed her to accomplish a wider range of tasks. After smacking her lips, the maiden snaked out her red tongue and captured her father without any hesitation. \n\nShe has ingested stars before. A bright star that was deemed eternal was to her, no more than a colorful and bland candy. And she had ingested so many planets with sentient beings, whether as part of humiliating wars, wars in terms of asking for affiliations, as well as all out wars from those that were bold enough to launch a Colossus against them. When devouring the enemy planets, Yaorong would not feel any moral burden. After all, it was war. Her actions were just like those of a Colossus equipped with planet destroying weapons, “destroying” a planet.\n\nBut today is different. What she swallowed was a planet of her own country. Her followers had spent decades renovating the planet just so it would provide a better texture for her, and everyone on the planet was also prepared to offer their lives for her. But they did not know that the God they served for so long could not bear to see her followers die in such a lowly manner. \n\nAnd held in her mouth right now is her most beloved follower, her most respected father, her direct kin. She refuses to hurt those who devoutly served her, so how would she ever try to hurt those that she loved the most?\n\n§P“Father…”§!\n\n§P“Please experience what they felt, as well~”§!\n\n………………"

After all, as the leader of the empire, you did not have much time to see your subordinates’ greetings. But the maiden who was greeting you obviously was not amongst them. She was both the god that protected the empire in the past and in the present, and the child who recognized you as her father.\n\n§PWhy do you always look at me with such… hmm, an unsatisfied look? I am clearly spectacular!§!\n\nThe adolescent maiden looked at you with a smile, but there was malicious intent written all over her golden eyes that were even more dazzling than the sun."

When your little girl had just hatched a few days ago, she tried to put you in her mouth and now... now she can hold your homeworld like a candy. You can not and dare not be too affectionate with this girl - her self-control has always been poor, and you're responsible for all of the Empire's citizens on the homeworld. §!\n\n §H However, the vast majority of the empire's citizens would be willing to give their lives for their princess. §!"

However, even so, her single breath almost caused orbital bombardment-level destruction. §!\n\n§P You understand why I can’t be too affectionate with you, right? §!\n\n§H Faced with your response, the girl still maintains her dissatisfied expression. However, her dissatisfaction didn't prevent her from cautiously taking several steps back after seeing that her little action almost caused the Empire’s homeworld to collapse. §!\n\n§H Yet, cautious as she may be, the girl maintains her dissatisfied expression.

Fortunately, since Yaorong was usually here, the nearby residents had already grown accustomed to avoiding her, so there were no casualties.\n\n§P \"Daddy... my teeth hurt.\" §!\n\nA soft voice came from Yaorong, sounding extremely aggrieved. She carefully poked her cheek with her finger, trying to relieve the pain but accidentally poked her sore gums, hurting so much that tears fell. She opened her little mouth, revealing her gums with several broken teeth, her red tongue looming into view, carrying a hint of seductive charm. Her two dragon horns glistened like obsidian in the sunlight, swaying gently as she shook her head and pouted, looking very adorable.\n\nHer delicate, porcelain face was wrinkled in a ball, and Yaorong sobbed as she reached out to you, her fleshy little hands waving randomly in the air, seemingly seeking your comfort. Her golden dragon horns shone in the sunlight, and her dimmed dragon wings trembled slightly."
gts_god_keeper.25.a: "Just bear with it, it’ll stop hurting soon."
gts_god_keeper.26.desc: "§P \"Waa... okay...\" §!\n\nYaorong replied with grievance, gently rubbing her tail tip against your back as if she were a puppy seeking comfort.\n\nThe scales on Yaorong’s tail shone with a dark red luster, shimmering under the sun. Her wings on her back drooped lifelessly on her sides as if she had lost the ability to fly. And her long tail moved restlessly on the ground, occasionally sweeping against nearby buildings, making a thumping sound.\n\n§P \"Daddy...\" §! Yaorong pouted, her eyes filled with tears, looking extremely pitiful. She raised one of her fleshy little hands, pointing to her mouth, signaling you to come and help her with her teeth.\n\nFaced with this huge yet so fragile little one, you were at a loss for what to do. Yaorong was at least several hundred times your size, and just lying on the ground, she was almost completely occupying the entire square.

Yaorong opens her eyes wide and frantically looks at the surrounding 'ruins,' then timidly looks at you, afraid that you will be angry. She pouts aggrievedly, and the red dragon tail behind her also droops dejectedly, smashing a few holes into the ground.\n\nWhen you don't do anything for a long time, Yaorong is afraid that you might really be angry with her, so she cautiously holds out one finger and waves it in front of you.\n\n§P\"Daddy, look here.\"§!\n\nEven though she knows that you won't blame her, the little one instinctively speaks to you in a spoiled tone, her voice is soft and sweet, as if she is trying to please you... But isn't it normal for a child to try to please their father with a bit of childish spoiledness?\n\nYou smile helplessly and reach out to grab Yaorong's finger. Her finger is two sizes bigger than your whole body - you begin to wonder if you will be able to climb on her hand by grabbing her fingerprints after your daughter grows up a little more. Perhaps your action gives Yaorong a bit of comfort, and she opens her mouth to show a big smile. Cute little fangs are faintly visible, revealing a childlike innocence... although in a bit these nearly ten-meter-long fangs are about to be pulled out.\n\n§P\"Daddy is the best!\"§!\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, Yaorong suddenly rolled onto her side, her massive body rolling on the ground, creating a cloud of dust. Caught off guard, you lose your footing and roll into Yaorong's soft, wide palm.\n\nThe touch is warm and soft, Yaorong's palm is fleshy and has the unique softness of a child. She feels great on your skin. The little one’s body temperature is higher than that of a human, being held in her palm is like lying on a soft, warm bed, making you feel extremely comfortable and cozy.\n\n§P\"Look, daddy, my tooth hurts so bad.\"§!\n\nYaorong pouts slightly, looking at you with a hint of grievance. She opens her mouth slightly, holding you in front of her face. Through the slightly opened jaws, you can see Yaorong’s pearly white teeth, as well as her pink tongue looming into view. It is just that four of her fangs are a strange dark color, making them particularly conspicuous.\n\nYaorong’s pink tongue licked her lips restlessly. She narrowed her eyes, and let out a soft, “Ah” while opening up her mouth wider, as if she was asking you to inspect her teeth closely.\n\nHer mouth was warm and moist, permeating a faint milky fragrance. You're lying on her soft lower lip looking up into the depths of her mouth as her throat is continuously moving, revealing an unspeakable tenderness."

You can even clearly see her little tongue writhing restlessly in her mouth, gleaming with water. Realizing that her tongue was moving a little too much, she lazily coiled it, and it was covered in small, pink granules, like a soft blanket.\n\nYaorong’s saliva uncontrollably flowed out from the corners of her mouth, gathering into a small puddle on her chin. The crystal-clear liquid refracted the sunlight, looking exceptionally tempting.\n\n§P\"Awoo--\"§!\n\nYaorong suddenly opened her mouth wide and let out a thunderous yawn. Her huge mouth is wide open in front of you, the warm, wet breath of a young girl rushing over you, making you dizzy. Her pink tongue curls up and stretches out, connecting with the pink palate by a strand of saliva, shining under the sunlight.\n\nYou swallow involuntarily as your mouth feels dry. Facing such a vast 'cave', you feel a little helpless. Yaorong tilts her head, staring at you with golden eyes full of confusion, seeming not to understand why you are so nervous.\n\n§P\"Daddy, what's wrong?\"§! Yaorong tilts her head, looking at you, her dragon tail wags around behind her, §P\"Is it - Yaorong... did I scare you?\"§!\n\nYou can't help but swallow again, carefully leaning forward to take a better look. However, just at this moment, Yaorong's tongue accidentally sweeps across your body, bringing a numb, electric sensation. Your whole body shivers, nearly slipping from her lips.\n\nThe rough tongue brushes over your skin, bringing a tingly, numbing touch. You quickly grab Yaorong's lips, trying to steady yourself but don't expect the little one to take your movements as an invitation. The next moment, you feel Yaorong's hot and humid tongue wrapping around your body, pulling you into her mouth.

But in reality, you didn't even look like a sugar grain on her huge tongue...\n\nYou were so confused by her actions that you couldn't even speak, and could only utter some unintelligible moans of discomfort.\n\nAfter what felt like a long time, Yaorong reluctantly spat you out of her mouth. You gasped for air, feeling like your whole body was soaked in the little one’s saliva, sticky and uncomfortable.\n\n§P\"Waa... I'm sorry, Daddy, I ... I just couldn't control myself...\"§!\n\nYaorong blinked as she looked at you, her eyes full of guilt and grievance.\n\nYou couldn't get angry about this, and you never get angry with your own child... In the end, you could only sigh, wiping the saliva off your face with the back of your hand while comforting her: §Y\"It's okay, Daddy is not blaming you. Be good, hold on a little longer and it will stop hurting soon.\"§!\n\nEven though her appearance was that of a child, she was not the kind of child that could be appeased with a piece of candy like in your memories - even if Yaorong needed candy to be appeased, it would probably have to be calculated by the ton.\n\n§P\"Daddy...\"§!\n\nThe little one's aggrieved and soft words interrupted your words.

That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?\n\n§Y\"I'm here.\"§!\n\nYaorong reached out, her plump, milky white little hand looked quite cute, but her grip strength... could probably crush a starship with an FTL engine into metal scraps, and you were just flesh and blood.\n\n§P\"I'm hungry!\"§!\n\nThe little one's hand fell in front of you. The little dragon is now just like the little dog in your memories, the kind that will show their belly to the sun when they are full.

If you want your little dragon to be full, you would have to call more people.\n\nYou stepped on the girl's tongue, The soft, blood-colored platform was full of the girl's fluids.

Yaorong lifted her foot, the black surface of her shoe suspended over the city, mud, gravel, pieces of battleships, and seawater poured down from it. She hasn't even set foot on this land yet, and she has already caused tens of thousands of casualties.\n\n§P The history of the world is written by our Supreme Emperor! The so-called supreme beings are just children nestled in his embrace… Of course, you can never hold me, Father. §! Yaorong laughed softly, and then lowered her foot. §P To the Empire, Audience! §!\n\nCivilizations will try their best to resist, and the Empire will not accept bloodless submission. And the girl who took the place of orbital bombardment... for civilizations, the destruction caused by a ‘similar’ individual is far more terrible than a neutron torpedo.\n\nEven the largest and toughest continent on this planet is extremely fragile in the face of a girl one hundred thousand times the size of a human, let alone humans and their creations. Whether it was the magnificent cities that took years to build or the powerful weapons dismantled from the sky giants, whether it was the highest leader of the country or the slaves plundered from other countries, they were all equally crushed into filth on Yaorong's soles. \n\n§P Father, are you watching? §!"
gts_god_keeper.105.a: "I am."
gts_god_keeper.105.a.response: "In fact, not only you, all the Empire's governors are standing on the Empire's flagship, watching this massacre - from a military point of view, dispatching your child to land combat has the same effect as letting the starship fleet carry out orbital bombardment. The purpose of both is to make this country surrender. It's just that the former can make them completely give up this boring idea of resisting.\n\n§P Only you? §!\n\nThe girl paused her destructive actions, and it was not clear whether her gaze was admiring or observing - or perhaps the only difference between the two was in your response.\n\nThe Empire's governors and the soldiers guarding the area are very tactfully leaving the area to you both."
gts_god_keeper.105.b: "Now, it's only me."
gts_god_keeper.105.b.response: "The girl's face finally changed.

gts_god_keeper.106.desc: "She has always happily accepted your requests, and this time is no exception. She's undressing. First, the luxurious court dress was taken off, leaving only her white underwear; then, she took off the stockings, which covered her to her thighs, and deliberately threw them in a section that remained intact; and last, she walked barefoot on this land. This most magnificent central continent has already turned into hell. Perhaps for them, even a barrage of neutron torpedoes would be a relief - but neither you nor Yaorong have any emotional ripples in your hearts. After all, the Empire gave them a chance to surrender. Now they need to pay the price for that arrogant choice.\n\nYaorong looked at her bare feet, the jade-white back of her feet still glimmered with bits of firelight, that was the only futile act of resistance these people could manage. Yaorong turned her head and looked at the city blocks that could barely be described as intact, and a breathtaking smile appeared on her beautiful face. Yaorong slowly knelt down so that her excessive movements would not completely destroy the entire continental shelf, after all, this was a toy her father had promised her, and she couldn't bear to break it so directly. Slender fingers landed on the city, and magnificent high-rise buildings or military bases had no resistance in front of such a white jade pillar. The fragments of the city flew at Yaorong’s fingertips. She seemed to be playing too happily and even added her dragon tail, which could traverse the continent, into the 'painting' process. An entire city block was replaced by her childlike doodle, and hundreds of thousands of human remains stuck to the gaps between her fingerprints and the tip of her tail - the result of this massacre, which could be described as tragic, was...\n\n§P Father, did you see that? §! Her figure was reflected on the Empire flagship's monitor. Yaorong is lying lazily on the continent, her eyes hazy, her huge dragon tail surrounded the city block that was vandalized. §P Uh, I don't mean for you to look at me... If you like how I look, I can dress like this for you after the war~ §!\n\nThe girl smiled charmingly, in stark contrast to the fiery hell beneath her - she raised her dragon tail and poked the area she wanted you to see. The words, Yaorong, a slightly crooked heart, and your name were ‘written’ in a crooked manner in what was no longer a city block. §P I do have other things I want to play with... but Father, they should surrender, right~ §!"

gts_god_keeper.107.desc: "§P You always do this, luckily Yaorong has gotten used to it, otherwise, she would really start crying~ §!\n\nWhen the Imperial Army landed, the largest continent on this planet was nothing but the area in front of them. Whether it was a building with a long history or giant cannons that could shoot down escort ships, they have all become part of the brown earth. The imperial army is now walking in these brown craters. The few soldiers who did not choose to shut themselves off are aware - they are currently stepping on the brown earth that was previously crushed under the feet of the Imperial Princess. The Empire always respects the strong, and beings as powerful as your child, who are called the 'Cosmic Conqueror' by the people of the Empire, have long had countless followers. And the Imperial army and navy are the Imperial organs with the most followers.\n\nSo, Yaorong, who is standing on the sea, is staring at these troops who are nominally under her command with a stern face. Her vision is enough to see the entire continent - all those who dare to resist have received the highest respect that the Empire gives to enemies. In the midst of that brown and black expanse, apart from the very few sanctuary she deliberately left, there is only the capital city that is still intact.\nOver 70% of the army bowed down to her within her footprints, and another 20% were planning to build their so-called wonders in her footprints, or even her shoe prints. Fortunately, another 10% still remember the mission that you sent them for.\nYaorong can hear their calls. “Supreme One.” “God.” “Saint.” “Savior.”\nYaorong was getting tired of it and took a step forward. Just like the hymn written for her by the citizens of the Empire - §YThe Supreme One flaps her sky-shading wings, and a city will fall into darkness, and hurricanes stir up waves of tens of meters at sea. When she moves, rivers are diverted, mountains collapse, and the earth is churned…§! Even though she was controlling her power, even though she has compressed her form.\n\n§P For the Empire! §! She said softly, but her voice was louder than a bell. §P For the Empire! §!\n\nWhether it was the Imperial Army that was dispatched for the landing, or the Navy on the starships, or the Imperial Governors on the flagship, they all shouted in unison. §P For our… great and eternal leader! §! The dragon raised her head and spread her sky-shading wings, and the monitor in the Empire's flagship clearly reflected her fanatical eyes."

Her father, the person she revered and loved the most, the sole and eternal leader of the Empire, was on it but even the Empire’s flagship is still too fragile in front of their princess. Even a blink of Yaorong’s eyes can completely destroy that starship of 'triumph'.\n\nBut that may have no meaning to her.  Even if the opponent was an ancient Fallen Empire, that incredibly powerful stagnation Holy Right wouldn't shake her.\n\n§P You are feeling fear, Father.  And you are not even afraid of the so-called 'powerful enemy', you are… afraid of me? §! Her golden eyes looked at you calmly. and before you could even say anything in defense of yourself, Yaorong suddenly smiled, making her take two steps back.\n\n§P You see, speaking with a straight face makes people feel difficult to deal with and even inspires awe - I simply wasn’t looking at you happily, and you started getting scared of me ~ §!

When Yaorong really stares at you blankly, even if you knew she would never hurt you, the feeling of being stared at by an apex predator outside of the food chain still makes people feel fearful.\n\n§P That’s right, Father ~ §! the little girl suddenly turned around. She used her huge tail to gently coil around the Empire flagship, but even then, the starship almost couldn’t withstand her terrifying force. §P Do you want to… get onto my body? §!\n\nApparently, this was not a multiple-choice question. If you refused, the girl would most likely just roll the starship into a metal disc with her tail - but fortunately this notification is not that bad; it was only about getting onto her body, no harm; you have done it before.\n\n§P Hmm, what a strange feeling, the last time you were on my body... §!"

After Yaorong finished speaking, a morbid blush appeared on her face... which made you feel unexpectedly scared.\n\n§P But… hehe, only if you are watching. §!

It is something her sister could never do.\n\n§Y (Talking about only with breasts) §!\n\nSeeing that the coronation ceremony was about to turn into a fight between two girls, you eventually burst out laughing. And the girl who has already been crowned the Dragon Queen was still the same as before. She was not bound by her divine nature... this was the best ending.\n\nYaorong rubbed the head of her younger sister, and then, with lightning speed, pinched you between her fingers - you haven't seen each other like this for a long time. The girl looked at you with a smile…looked at her father who was no longer young.\n\nShe was in makeup today, very beautiful, breathtakingly beautiful. Especially since she was laughing so happily… when was the last time this girl laughed so happily?\n\nYou realized you had forgotten a lot. You were so obsessed with power that you had almost forgotten your own daughter's face. But luckily, you still had time, and you could still accompany her in fulfilling the promise you once made.\n\n§P “As far as I know, many fathers don't really want to see their daughters suddenly being taken away by some strange and lucky bastard.” §!\n\nYaorong said this out of nowhere while rubbing her sister's head. And you are being pinched between the girl's two fingers, making it difficult to say anything... yes, she didn't want you to answer her at all. §P “But you can rest assured because neither me or little Tunbao will be taken away~” §!\n\nYaorong put you on her chest, and her dress, which was a mixture of gold and black, was exposing the two full hemispheres of her breasts. It was definitely no problem for that colossal structure to engulf her beloved father."

Its size wasn't that much smaller when compared to a star, and its mass even occupied 20% of the entire system. But what it was facing was a magnificent being whose form, when fully extended, could treat a star as food.  In fact, if Yaorong didn't intentionally adjust her traction, then the Empire's home world or the star would likely have become filth on her body. \n\n§P “Aren't you… just the same as all the rest?” §!\n\nA majestic body that was ten thousand times the size of the Titan beings landed on the planet.

And at this moment, such a dense city, in the face of a being ten thousand times larger than its creators, was clearly doomed to fail.\n\nAs usual for these Titan class girls’ behaviour when facing other civilizations, Yaorong lifted her foot and then stomped down.  \n\nYaorong’s long boots easily crushed the tall buildings, which was more majestic than a megastructure for normal humans, into filth. Those buildings that were millions of meter, or even close to ten million meters, were still as fragile as a biscuit under the Dragon Queen’s feet.\n\n§P “Because you are nothing more than this.” §!\n\nAfter causing thousands of casualties (beings of the Titan class are naturally not in the same magnitude as normal beings), Yaorong pulled her foot back from her boot. Her soft and tender white feet, covered in black stockings, should have been beautiful works of art worthy of being admired, or on the more extreme side, the tastiest meal in the world – however, all that the Titan girls, who could easily destroy civilizations, could see, was the shadow of death cast down from that foot.\n\nThe black silk foot landed.\n\nAlthough it was an act of slaughter and destruction, the girl's actions only contained a sacred religious meaning and a bewitching sense of beauty. Those Titan girls who were usually perceived to be a civilization's disaster, were perhaps just as lowly as the civilizations they step on, in front of an existence of a higher level.  \n\nThe girl seemed to be dancing, only her form was much more graceful than those of normal dancers, and furthermore, she also had membrane wings and a dragon tail providing support – of course, the greatest difference was that with every elegant step, she was bringing along an unparalleled force of nature.\n\nWhether it was the Titan girls or those weak civilizations they plundered, whether it was the starships built with their FTL engines or the giant cannons whose bore were enough to fit satellites , or anything else that was in this planet; they were not able to shake or resist this… massacre.\n\nThey indeed had no grievances with her, but then again, how many civilizations, which were destroyed under the feet of these Titan girls, had any hatred for them?\n\nYaorong stopped her dance after feeling a slight blush appearing on her face after that previous, cold and emotionless state. She held her skirt, which wasn't all that long, out and offered respect to the sky. That was transmitted to the satellites of the stellar community.   \n\nAnd that small satellite successfully captured the scene of the Dragon Queen  stretching out her majestic body, where her perfect and flawless silk-covered foot was about to slip back into her long boot – but if one was to zoom in a little, one could see that the art-like silk foot was stuck to countless buildings, corpses and even the magma that dripped out was enough to obliterate some weak civilizations. \n\nOr… zoom out a little. Compared to the Titan Girls, the mountains were all replaced by sets of footprints, and those continental plates that could endure the Titan girls' existence were now letting out screams of sorrow as they spewed the molten lava out of the very core."

That leader who ruled a hundred billion lives was trembling before her as if he was a child who had made a mistake… but he didn't do anything wrong,  and those who made a mistake had already been punished.   \n\n§P “Do you want me to help you perform the execution, or will you do it yourselves?” §!\n\nThe leader did not respond, and neither did any of the citizens of the vassal state, but the collective emotion showed that they had already reached an answer.\n\n§P “Then… good luck.” §!\n\nYaorong muttered softly, and her dragon tail, which was large enough to encompass a star, casually drew a square on that planet.  The oceans started to boil, the mountains collapsed, everything in the world yielded to her supreme power; she was only defining the boundary for that somewhat entertaining battle between caged beasts."

She had swallowed entire planets belonging to enemy nations, and she enjoyed their starships desperately unleash their firepower upon her – she did not do this to satiate her hunger, she was enjoying the feeling of her enemies’ anger, despair and helplessness… but today, she did not purposefully savour that despair she has consumed.\n\nYaorong knew that those she had swallowed inevitably contained innocent people, and not everyone was desperately launching useless attacks against her.\n\n§R But she didn't spare any of them. §!\n\nHer tongue still had a large part of the city cluster and the crowd that was corroded by her saliva.

But this time, we do not have and do not need a god to shield us from the disaster.\n\nIt was a rift that appeared in the system, and it was regularly emitting a message written in our ancient language:\n\n§r With a rebellious sword, we will reach the stars! §!"

gts_god_keeper.1001.desc: "Beyond the rift was a vast expanse of space, where even the girl, as vast as a planet, could stand on that seemingly illusory “ground.” As the research ship cautiously performed a scan, a white giant egg that was the size of a planet stood at the end of this fantastical space.\n\nWhen the research ship approached, aside from that pure white giant egg, which could be described as connecting to the heavens, there was a tattered and broken starship, which could be described as an antique that was lying quietly next to it. On the outermost layer of the ship’s paint, there were words engraved in our ancient language. This was enough to tell any science officer that they should not hesitate.\n\n“Leader…”\n“Go and record them.”\n“I shall not fail you!”\n\nAnd so the small research ship biubiubiu flew past in front of Yaorong, who clearly seemed to be trying her best not to blow them away with a single breath. \nThe research ship stopped at the base of the pure white egg that connected to the heavens, as the science officer, like a pilgrim, fell to the ground, groping at the starship that was now considered an ancient relic for the empire.\n\n§Y“Since ancient times, mankind has looked at the brilliant sky with admiration; countless religions have placed their gods and their spiritual dependence in the universe.  The sun was their gentle and life-giving god, dispelling darkness and embracing light. The moon is the object of yearning in the dark night, symbolizing holiness yet also an extreme madness and temptation. The sages used to say that the stars are not a single god.  On a starry night, with no obstructions and without a cloud in the sky, a wondrous stream of stars stretches across the sky - all these lights come from a holy giant serpent, and its scale is perplexing.  Its essence cannot be observed through imagination, so much so that the only way to glimpse it in their real world is only through the observation of the countless stars birthed  from its body. When the collective beliefs of mankind gather together, their expression of faith also becomes apparent: a real star god, a real god flying in the universe. ”§!\n\nThe governor spoke each and every word that was carved on the stone tablet that was erected in front of the silver white giant egg.  However, every time he said a word, his voice trembled a little more.\n\n§Y“Even that star god, the god that was created by countless stars, the god who received the faith of all living beings in space was not invincible.”§!\n\n“Leader… that was the precursors and their god.”\n\nCivilization is never the lonely vigil. Our clan’s development was also inseparable from the full support from the precursors - from our language to the design concept of the FTL engine, we received help from the precursor civilizations whom we had never met.  But, aside from that Ideal City Ruins, which had been transformed into a statue for our God, they did not leave any traces on our planets!\n\nExcept for the little dragon, who didn't know much but was playing with her tail on the side, were joy and amazement filling everywhere in this rift.   It’s not that the little dragon wasn’t aware of what her father was talking about, but she simply didn't know what the precursors meant. In fact, if you had not put on an expression like " If you move that egg again, you will stay in the corner to think about things", the little dragon might have started eating the pure white giant egg, which had the same scale as her; after all, the little one rarely gets to see such \"normal food\". \n\n§Y “Gods are not invincible, gods will bleed, gods will die.”§!\n\n§Y “We will defy the gods.” §!"

At that time she could still be called He. Her true form was a giant snake that was hundreds of meters long… just like the descriptions in our national religion's holy book.\n\nWhen we were faced with famine, He brought the giant beasts which were beyond our strength to defeat; when we encountered floods, He used His majestic body to dredge the waterways; when we were in a civil war, He… first turned into she. \n\nThe mother goddess swayed her snake tail and drew out the dividing line. Her beautiful yet inviolable face only showed kindness and love.  The two countries stopped the war, not out of fear due to the power of the mother goddess,  but because children do not want to worry their mothers… or make her angry.\n\nWe developed, and the mother goddess also became more powerful.  Before the first FTL engine was invented, our mother had already set the groundwork for our city districts.  And after that, what she liked doing most was just lying in the ocean watching us work – with the majestic form of the mother goddess, we probably didn't look much different than ants.  But her kind and loving gaze was no different than a mother’s.\n\nWe yearned for the stars, our civilization yearned for the stars, and our illusions about the mother goddess were also born from those billions of stars.  But the stars are also the origin of danger for the world.  \n\nWhen the ship equipped with the first generation FTL engine was launched, the mother goddess lost her control.  The purple eyes, which were always full of love, turned red, and a silver white snake tail pierced the ship... killing countless lives.  \n\nAfter several ‘launches’ and ‘divine punishments’, we finally understood. Even the gods whom we had imagined due to the stars have their thoughts restricted by the rights of the gods to explore the real universe - our mother goddess was born from our original imaginations of the stars, but as the technologies developed, our understanding of stars gradually deepened and this became the poison that corroded the god. \n\nOur leader eventually went to have an audience with god. As for what they talked about, I am not sure. But what I do know is that we were given time, and we were given a final chance to witness the stars. \n\nAfter the second generation FTL engine was installed on the ‘Escape Ship’, we began to rampantly build weapons, we even used the old chemical fuel rockets to land on three planets and transformed them into ‘colony planets.’ We also built a magnificent metropolis. We left a simplified form of our writings and FTL engine diagrams, as well as our history in there. … We do not know how much can be preserved, but it was the last things we could do.  \n\nOn the last day of the fifteenth year, the voice of the mother goddess rang out again on the planet, but it was no longer the loving voice. \n\n§r “Are you ready, my… children?” §!\n\n“We are ready to step into the stars, Mother.”\n\n......\n\nThe science officer turned his back around, his face, which was always enthusiastic when it came to research, now showed a rare hint of hesitation.\n\n“Leader, should we continue?”"

Executing protocol-017.”§!\n\nSuch an automated response system could already be called rudimentary to the current Empire, but the content it carried might even overturn the current state of the Empire.  \n\n§Y “Ah, inheritors, hello there. Since the Omega system has determined this to be the execution of protocol-017, then you must have already met our mother god. Please do not be afraid of her and also do not try putting up futile resistance.”§!\n\n“If you design something like this idiotic AI after we get back, I’ll feed you to Yaorong.” \n\n§Y “Inheritors, since you have also come here, you should have already witnessed the true stars. It is a pity that we were unable to admire them carefully when we fled, and the second life given to us by the mother goddess does not support me to observe the stars - I apologize, I have been talking too much, so let us get to the point.\n\n“Our act of defiance has failed.  The power of thoughts was too convenient and too powerful, and we had lost the opportunity to resist even before we became fully immersed in Her quagmire.”\n\n“But inheritors, you are different, you have infinite potential, a brighter future! You do not need to replicate our act of defiance.”\n\n“I do not know what your god is like, and I also do not know whether He is as gentle and loving as our mother god. But no matter what, He must love you, and He must treat your lives more important than His own.”\n\n“And now that you have come, it also proves that our final gift is in effect.  Your god, His divinity has been killed….  According to our mother goddess, her unborn sister may regrow from her childhood again.” \n\n“Protocol 017, playback finished.”§! After a brief silence, another voice rang out. §Y “Ah… it actually is Protocol 17. It seems that the mother god’s plan worked out well, that’s great!”§!\n\nUnlike the previous monotonous and idiotic voice, the voice that was speaking now was a rather weathered and aged male voice, which without a doubt belonged to the precursor civilization.  \n\n§Y “Please greet my mother goddess for me, and also apologize to your god for us… For the preservation of our civilisation, we had no choice but to resort to any means necessary. If He hasn’t appeared yet, then also please rest assured.  Death is not the end for such a great existence.   After the long slumber has ended, He will once again, like a mother, protect you with kindness.”\n\n“May you, touch the stars.”\n\n“It is out there.”§!\n\nThis time, there were no further sounds, that was probably the last words left behind by the precursors. But there was no time to mourn the precursors, as they have left behind a mess… their mother goddess was currently leaning on your dragon daughter’s chest, they revealed to you the power of thoughts, and they used the embers of their civilization to tell you what kind of power a god possesses.  Although the last thing was mostly useless, as if your little dragon decided to strike against the Empire, it was estimated that over than seventy percent of the Empire would consider that an honor.

After all, the little one could hold a grudge. \n\n“Mm.” In fact, you did not want to respond so coldly, but you did not dare to respond so passionately as the little dragon could send you to the depths of the earth in a moment. But if you were to respond to her passionately, then the self-proclaimed rebirth dragon would be no different than a puppy seeing their master. \n\nYears of being with her also made the little dragon understand your good intentions – the little one smiled as she raised her foot towards. You could see the residue of city districts and fragments of the planet on her black shoe sole.   \n\n§r “Sister…” §!\n\nJust when the little dragon was about to stomp, a shout interrupted that scene of a harmonious father and daughter.  \n\n§P “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid…” §!\n\nYaorong retracted her foot, and instead gently caressed the girl that was with her. Her face was definitely that of a child, innocent and endearing. Fortunately, with a girl of the same size as her by her side, Yaorong finally showed a slightly more mature aspect. \n\nTo be honest, if you were able to fully see the scene, then the scene of the little dragon comforting her ‘sister’ would be very alluring; however, the little dragon had shared her view, but still without the shared view, you could only see your own daughter with her high heels, and might not even be able to see her ankles.      \n\nWhile your thoughts were wandering, that girl, the mother god of the precursor civilization focused her gaze onto you.\n\n§r “Daddy…” §!"

From my perspective,  the way this girl was refusing to get out of bed was just too adorable - well, after all I was now standing on her tail and from this angle I could directly gaze at the sleeping face of my silly daughter.\n\nThe majestic dragon was now snuggling like a kitten, and her supple face looked so good that I wanted to bite her - especially under the sunlight, that my silly girl look like a cake.\n"

The mother goddess's voice was soft and weak, which sounded like a girl who has not even reached adulthood yet. This was not just due to my biased opinions or due to the natural filter buff I had as her old father – this girl really does sound that way when she acts coy!\n\nHowever, since my little one had said so, then isn’t it natural that I just take a bite out of her… that’s not too much, right…\n\nI lifted my head, gazing at Yaorong’s sleeping face. The faint dragon breath of hers grazed my face, it was warm and comfy, and it wasn’t going to scorch me - then I was desperately realizing that if my little one maintained her steady breath and didn’t move her tail, then I would never be able to reach her face for the rest of my life…\n\n§r “Father, good morning… You seem like you could use a little help.” §!\n\nRight right… wait, have you sneaked into your sister’s room again?

Tell Tunbao with as gentle tone as possible; Little one, I don’t have the appetite when you’re standing like that? If those words were to actually come out of my mouth, then that dark hearted little girl would immediately agree before selling her old man out while waking her sister up… That girl would definitely do it!\n\n§Y “Don’t look at me…” §! \n\n§r “Father, are you embarrassed?

Do you really need to make such a big deal out of it! \n\nBut those crimson figures clearly did not plan on letting me go. The graceful figure, which had been propped against the bed, started to slowly lower down; the beautiful body of the girl was slowly leaning forward… All I can is that I’m glad Tunbao’s figure is all flat, as if it was the same as her sister or Wolfy, I would probably be crushed between her breasts here… \n\n§r “So, please allow me to learn how to face the father……” §! \n\nWhat are you trying to learn! \n\n§P  “Ugh?” §!\n\nCrap, the protagonist has woken up. I should never think of surviving if I was actually going to do it under the eyes of our girls now - the offense of desecrating a supreme god would at least qualify one for the slow slicing death.

After all, I was still plastered all over my little one's face –but I could see Tunbao’s expression, the little girl could clearly see I am being teased! She was indeed doing it on purpose! \n\n§P “Ugh… come and sleep with your sister, Tunbao…” §!"

But before I could even contact ［The Serpents］ and connect with the little ones who had just been playing with me in her mouth, I felt a terrible tremor coming from under my feet – the crimson earth had been raised up with force and in a blink of an eye would become one with the sky."

Her beautiful face was slightly distorted due to her flustered emotions. In response, the huge sun behind her - the magnificence of the corona was raging with the excitement of her words, as if she was trying to make her crown look more dignified. \n\n§P  “Do you think these toys are more important than me!” §!\n\nThe sky-shading membrane wings were spread out, and  the black wings that were enough to cover the sun only brought the shadow of death and despair , and all of that, was nothing more than a simple physiological function of Yaorong. \n\n§P “Have you seen clearly, this is my power, this is a power that… your Empire cannot resist or endure!” §!\n\nShe stretched out one finger toward the home planet of the Empire, and that white finger, which was more elevated than a space elevator, could easily rewrite the environment of the planet, as well as erase all the intelligent life on it.  \n\nThankfully, she did not lower her finger and was maintaining that stance. She was waiting for your reply."

gts_god_keeper.3014.desc: "§P “Okay, Father, then let’s talk~” §!\n\nThe girl’s form instantly compressed into a titan class form of “only ten thousand meters” as she landed onto the homeworld. After briefly surveying her surroundings, Yaorong started carefully taking steps towards the place you were in. \n\nHowever, even as she was pacing lightly, the vibration from her titan-class body brought a bone-deep feeling of helplessness. Even the defense forces stationed at the Empire's capital weren't able to make an effective stop, and in but a moment, Yaorong was standing before the main gate of the palace. Those molten gold eyes glanced lightly at the main gate of the palace - that hundreds-of-meters high gate that took countless skilled artisans years to build, which would symbolize the absolute power of her rule weren't even as tall as the sole of her boot.\n\n§P “Will you not come out and talk, Fa-ther-~” §!\n\nYaorong crouched down, looking at you with a smile.\n\n§P  “It seems that your toy army that you took decades to forge was nothing more than a joke～” §!\n\n§P “Or perhaps, you are still unwilling to admit it?” §!\n\nThe girl’s expression carried a hint of mockery, but you completely approved of her current actions - a navy as powerful as the Empire’s had actually been no match for a single girl. So it was only natural for the girl who held such terrifying war power to show you such an expression… what’s more, she was your child, would it be bad for her to throw a bit of a tantrum?\n\n§P “Oh, my Father, why are you so silent. Are you unwilling to have a good talk?” §!"
gts_god_keeper.3014.a: "Okay, Yaorong, daddy was wrong."
gts_god_keeper.3015.desc: "In the past the little one would have happily accepted it the moment she heard that you had admitted to being wrong, and she would try her best to stick to you - but today was different, as the little dragon was holding a grudge. What you said back then about “the Empire is more important\" had hurt the little one to the core.   \n\n§P “Just an apology? My, Father?” §!\n\nEven when she was squatted, that body that was compressed to the titan level was still oppressive. And because of the two of the unique status, no one dared interfere with this father-daughter conflict.\n\n§P   “Have you forgotten the fate of the civilizations that were defeated by the Giantess Empire? Just an apology can subdue their greed and thirst?” §!\n\n§P  “Are you joking?”§!\n\nOnly now you realized that that something was off. It seems like your silly girl didn’t plan to just let you off so easily. She was really going to do it!  \n\nThen next moment you started to think if you should run, but a body that was still at the titan level was clearly not something that you can escape from. You might not even be able to run away from a step in just a single hour! \n\n§P   “Then, are you ready to receive your punishment?” §!\n\nA pure white finger was slowly reaching in. The magnificent palace could not even give you a moment to resist. And thus, you calmly accepted your fate.

The only source of light was from the sky - not a star, but a pair of golden eyes that were brighter than a star.  You suddenly realized where you were.   \n\nThe little one shrank her neck back with a hint of fear, but then she thought of what had happened several months ago - her father who she had flung into her shoe, had said that his toy-like empire was more important than her. How would she be able to tolerate that?  \n\n§P  “I…” §!  The interior of Yaorong's shoe was filled with her unique, foot-like scents. Even though Yaorong was considered to be a very clean girl, she would regularly bury her feet into a star to perform maintenance - but she had just been in a ‘fierce battle’, and her feet which had paced across the cosmos were still secreting sweat. \n\nWhat made you feel despair wasn’t Yaorong's shoe scent, but instead it was you thinking about how her physiological functions alone were enough to kill most humans.  But after thinking that far you also started to feel lucky, after all this girl did not decide to throw the Empire’s capital or conquer a couple cities near her to vent her anger. She was totally able to do it, but she had only thrown you inside.\n\n§P “Stay inside my shoe and reflect on your actions!” §!\n\nThe light from above faded away. That must have been Yaorong retracting her head, and now it was time for you to start considering… how you could live for a longer time within her shoe. The little one had purposefully thrown you into the deepest point of her shoe and she had even thoughtfully dropped you into  the lines that had been carved out from her constant walking. The traces she has left from casually walking was already making something that felt more despairing to climb than even the world’s largest pot-hole.\n\nAfter all,  the depth of this basin was nearly a million meters, and at the lowest point of this basin, you could even see the corpses of enemy army, wreckage of starships… and even some pieces of what had once been planets remaining.  \n\nThat was the filth that lingered in the sole of your daughter's feet, this was also the beginning and the end of a civilization. Perhaps this was the end of the Empire too.\n\n§P  “Do you… regret it?” “Daddy?” §!"

Her sky-shading membrane wings also covered above the homeworld. But at this moment, that membrane wings which was known to bring despair did not bring death and despair. On the contrary, that dark black membrane wings had brought an odd sense of holiness.   \n\n§P “I am your child after all…” §!\n\nShe wanted to embrace you, but her body was simply too huge. Even the Empire’s homeworld, the largest Gaia planet [Root.capital_scope.GetName], was still like a slightly bigger football to Yaorong - she wasn't even able to take the football into her arms without hurting the weak lives that adhered to this small star.   \n\n§H Yaorong has always only ever cared about you.§! \n\nBut for you, she could also choose to love the Empire… or rather to treat the citizens of the Empire with gentleness. \n\n§P  “I don’t know how you perceive me… I was just being a little temperamental. I really didn’t mean anything by it…” §!\n\nThe girl’s voice was becoming increasingly flustered. She was scared - she was afraid to lose you and  was afraid of being estranged by you.  The god that could easily destroy the Imperial Navy, was still a girl who could not do without her father, when she was in your presence. \n\nEveryone is born to be cared for by another person until they grow to a point where they are able to take care of others, whenever a person is in front of someone who had always cared for them, that person will be brought to the feelings of being teased, getting their blankets pulled, and getting kicked or called by others, no matter how much they grow. this behavior is like the animalistic habits that was carved into their very bones - even if a single finger of hers was now enough to completely destroy the ecosystem of a planet."

gts_god_keeper.3021.desc: "§P “Father, you have had a good sense of style after all…” §!\n\nYaorong brushed off the black dress she was wearing, pretending that she was brushing off some non-existent space dust. She then looked at the navy that was on their way to their homeports with a hint of provocation in her eyes. It was like a big dog that received praise from its owner as it flaunted it to other small dogs…\n\n§P  “Of course I’m more powerful than your Empire, and I'm also more… important~”§! \n\nThe girl’s body got close to the homeworld.  Her cherry red lips, which were deliberately closer, were all that the citizens of the Empire could see in the sky - right. Even the Empire’s home world,  [Root.capital_scope.GetName], the so-called Gaia planet, would nothing but a hard candy that had white bacteria growing all over it to Yaorong.   \n\n§P “However, father, although you have made the right choice, there can’t be no punishment for losing so horribly with these exercises~”\n\n“Right?” §!\n\nThe words that girl spoke with a charming smile sounded undeniable.  She was not asking for your opinions but simply informing you of a fact."

After giving you a few minutes to think, she brought her lips towards you - the capital of the Empire was also its most unique office district.  The palace unique to you was located on an artificial island. The original purpose of building it there was to stop your little dragon from going wild and causing chaos to the other citizens of the Empire, and now the measure had proven to be useful… though you could not do anything about it.   \n\nThe palace which had been built over the course of several years by numerous skilled artisans did not have any resistance in front of the girl’s lips; and that was the result of your silly girl lowering her power and form to the titan level - after all, it would only take her a swallow to eat up the entire homeworld of the Empire. \n\n§P  “Father…” §!\n\n *Gulp*.\n\nThe girl’s gulp broke through the eardrums in an instant.  In the endless darkness, you only heard two remaining sentences.  \n\n§P  “You now…” \n\n“Belong to me.”§!"

But even a dam that had a thousand miles to its name could still be defeated by ants - and the Imperial Navy did not perform as well as ants.  \n\nBeams of light, cannons, neutron torpedoes and nuclear missiles were released towards your child. This power, which should have been able to destroy a planet, could do nothing more than spark a few sparks on her scaly body.   \n\nHowever even the dragon, which was born from thoughts and is inherently fearless, still got a little annoyed by the weapons of mortals - during this unequal and unfair fight, Yaorong’s shields were finally broken, and that was also a symbol of your agreed upon victory.    \n\nThe ships, which had not been forced to use their “emergency hyperdrive by the girl yet” surrounded their princess, and now the girl, who was seen as a god and the sole inheritor to the Empire, was smiling gaily as she raised her hand, signifying that she had lost.    \n\n§P  “You were really amazing, Father~” §!\n\nThe little dragon did not have any sarcastic undertones, and it seemed like she really meant it when she was saying those words - but what was there to praise?  The power of the Empire’s reckless barrage only broke the shields that were supporting the girl. Her body itself was one of the most powerful weapons in the galaxy!  \n\n§P  “Since you have won…” §!\n\nThe girl, who had raised her hands to signify her surrender, patted them together, and then several chains, which were of a golden color, bound themselves together as if they were constricting a person like pythons – that girl, with her wicked taste, had even used a ribbon to tie a bow on her horns. \n\n§P “I remember you talking to me about the scenes where civilisations were defeated by those Giantess Empires.” §!\n\n§P “The glorious citizens of the Empire became slaves, and all of those former imperial clans and royalties became… objects for small ones to take it out on.” §!\n\nThe girl cut in before you could even speak, and she looked towards the capital of the Empire with a displeased look - or rather, she was looking at you, given the fact that her eyes were much larger than the  palace that you were currently in. It was too easy for her to see you.\n\n§P “You want that too?” §!\n\n Yaorong’s tone was now colder. The traces of her once faint smile were long gone.

You don't even dare to imagine her real strength. \n\n§P “You… best not.” §!\n\nThe girl raised an eyebrow before making the restraints on herself even tighter.  There was a faint smile hanging from the corners of her lips, that you would never dare to imagine too much… After all this girl, had already grown up.  She was no longer the innocent and cute little dragon who was as pure as a blank sheet of paper. Now if you had a teasing way of handling her, Yaorong may use that as a reason to finish you off completely. "

The princess in fairy tales, who was supposed to be as delicate and beautiful as flowers, was now covered in sharply angled dragon scales, with all of her fragile flesh hidden behind what had become a resilient exterior of thorns. \n"
gts_god_keeper.4000.a: "Hello, my little dragon."
gts_god_keeper.4000.a.response: "Yaorong was dressed in a very flamboyant outfit today. Her pure white dress was so pristine and immaculate like an angel’s, even if her legs were still covered with black stockings that symbolized desire… After observing her with a slightly more perceptive eye, you noticed that something was off – the way your little one was dressed, was that like she was prepping up for her lover? \n\n§P “As far as I know, many fathers didn't really want to see their daughters suddenly being taken away by some strange and lucky bastard… Father, is that you opinion as well?” §!\n\nThe girl's tone had a hint of testing in it, while you were thinking that when a yellow hair comes up, you should slice that person into four pieces or five, or should you just crunch them up into pieces and feed it to your own daughter…"

gts_god_keeper.4000.b.response: "Those words, which were at the very most a form of praise, did not attract Yaorong like you expected. Your little one just tilted her head, gave you a fleeting smiling look before lowering her head once more.

This kind of storyline should only appear in some of the Empire’s… adult forums, how could it appear in real life?\n\nBut after some thought you were able to let it go. After all, those two “little ones,” when they were at their smallest size one of them is still one hundred meters tall, not to mention when both of them were fully stretched out, they could use stars as toys or snacks… In a sense,  your two little ones do look like a good match.  This was also good because it allowed you to drop the idea of slicing that yellow haired bastard up into five pieces to feed Yaorong"

After being with her for so long, you know there is trouble when the little dragon was making such an awkward face. For example, the last time she almost crushed all of the Empire's fleet, and attempted to intimidate the capital of the Empire...  (raising a blade against father)"

gts_god_keeper.4000.d.response: "§P “Father…” §!\n\nEven after running she still spent over half a minute after she turned her head over to face you, and such act would make the image that you created of “father” to lose some of its worth.  As after all, you did always trade off these two extreme forms in the heart of your child - she saw you as a god who was worthy of her and of the Empire’s worship, or….like a horny insect licking the remains of the planet and starships on the insoles of her shoe.\n\n§P  “Every child hopes that their father is an upright hero. To them, their father is the sky, the mountain, something that was unmovable and unbreakable. Father is Ultraman, who can remove the small monsters from their lives.  Even if their Dad worked every day while doing a simple and unnecessary job, in their children’s eyes, what he has done was still the most amazing thing in the world…” §!\n\nThe little dragon muttered.\n\n§P  “Although both me and Tunbao feel that the work you do is useless… after all, your empire is still too weak, right Father.

And at this size she was now, what you could now see was only the little dragon's high heels.\n\nAfter adjusting her dress and applying her light makeup, she really looks like a queen.

You’re girl was a majestic being, who when fully stretched could be much, much bigger than a star!\n\nBut… your doubts had been slightly settled, after all your daughter was offering you some love, and not some strange, yellow haired being.

A barbarian. You never imagined that this uncivilized word would ever be used to describe Yaorong, but at this moment, all you could use to describe her were only the barbaric traits.

gts_god_keeper.4006.desc: "§P “Then… I guess I need to teach you well.” §!\n\nThe crimson giant tongue reached out, enveloping you and pulling you into her mouth.  The crimson world was now the entirety of your domain… but this was just the beginning. Yaorong slowly raised her body, changing her squatting posture into a more alluring duck-like style, her hand touching her lips, preventing the tiny one from her mouth from thrashing too violently, while her other hand was casually pressed against her smooth and warm thigh.\n\nShe could hear you sob, and she could also feel your resistance - and by that, it was only a perfunctory and faked resistance. The scene now was like a cabbage with legs reaching out to steal a pig, but the pig was still small and had not grown a single hair yet, as it was still buried by the cabbage leaves. \n \nYou who had ‘escaped’ from the mouth of the dragon, were now covered in the bodily fluids of your dearest, even after struggling you weren't able to escape the feeling of being suffocated.  You wiped your face, finally getting rid of the fluids on your face, and finally looking at the dragon that had a rosy hue on her face. \n\nThen a red world began to open once more, swallowing you."

gts_god_keeper.4007.title: "Agreement"
gts_god_keeper.4007.desc: "§P  “You… agreed to that?!” §!\n\nYes, you agreed to this. After all age has never been a constraint for love, and neither was species - look at legends like Xu Xian who was a normal human with a serpent spirit and also the ghastly knight Ning Caichen, they were also able to do such cross-species acts, then why couldn’t you do the same? \n\nYaorong’s molten golden pupils were now fixed on you, and the previous cautiousness had now disappeared, replaced with excitement and joy… Shamefully for a father, this was the first time you had seen your daughter this happy. \n\nAnd after rarely expressing such jubilation, Yaorong became quiet as if she was a lamb - able to make a passionate woman like dragon to become as quiet as a lamb, making the most magnificent shooting stars to stop and become the starlight that forever illuminated the star sky, and even the cicadas had stopped chirping.  This quietness was for thought and for that long awaited moment… This perhaps, was the magic of love.  "
gts_god_keeper.4007.a: "......"
gts_god_keeper.4008.desc: "Although your reply was not a complete confirmation, that was enough for your little one to see this as the start of a relationship. But on the other side , your other daughter did not think the same way - this little girl, who was respectfully called the Cosmic Serpent, once again felt the urge to transform into the monk Fahai and question Xu Xian if he knew that his lover was actually a white snake? Then Xu Xian would proudly say that he was willing, that he liked it, and was willing for his lover to suck his soul dry you old, bald donkey, what’s it to you ?!\n\nEven though she was actually the white snake in this story.jpg\n\nBut your little Tunbao was still quite considerate, once she saw you and her 'sister' about to perform an act of intimacy, she had consciously backed away, and even used her power to shut out the area that the two were in from the capital of the Empire in case her sister’s fervor destroyed the small planet.  \n\n§P  “Then shouldn’t we create a pact? Hus… Husband?” §!\n\nYaorong's eyes were lowered, and now there was nothing else inside but adoration and doting…Yes, doting, those kinds of expressions were emanating from your child - but she was the one who should've been receiving the doting.  \n\n§Y “Now?” §!\n\n§P  “Of course it’s now! Or do you plan on……” §!\n\nThe girl suddenly got up, and the pure black dress was fluttering as it resonated with her movements of joy - her strength was capable of changing the laws of the universe, but she was using such power to vent her feelings of joy and excitement.  Just like how a dog loves to rub their head against their owner to express their affection, it’s stupid, but it was effective.  \n\n§P  “You will not go back on it, right?” §!"

gts_god_keeper.4009.desc: "Her slender and delicate hands should have been held in a stronger power hand as she would be carefully played with, and savored as if she were a work of art.  But now these beautiful hands were casting a sky-shading shadow over the Empire’s capital - it wasn’t that first time Yaorong had done this, but this time, she did not do it with the intent of toying around. Yes, today Yaorong was reaching her hand out towards you with full of expectations. \n\nFour titan-class ships along with The Empire’s flag ship pulled together and formed a “circle,” which was a megastructure that was several times larger than a star gate! It was the greatest wonder in human civilization! And it was just… a ring.  \n\nIt’s base was made out of billions of minerals and alloys, and it had been given the concept of “circle” when it was being born in the Empire’s forges. And on top of the ring, it was not some worldly diamond - what right did the carbon element, which is used by mortals, have to taint the fingers of a god? Only the gods or her most loved item were worthy enough to be the object for the god to adorn.\n\nHer dragon scales and your blood, which was barely visible, was added to the top of the ring. Normally there was no way that the small amount that you had could cover the ring to any visible extent, as this ring was at the scale of being comparable to the Empire’s capital city – but your child – or should I say your “bride,” has that ability, to arbitrarily rewrite the rules of the world."

gts_god_keeper.4010.desc: "§P “Hu… Husband.” §!\n\nShe still could not forget this title, but it was not like you weren't the same way. Perhaps the new generation of the Empire didn’t know how complex the relationship was between their emperor and queen, but there was no lack of veterans, who shared the same age as you, who were watching this ceremony.   \n\nThe Empire’s flagship and the Titan ships set their thrusters to the maximum, successfully putting the ring, which had a price that could not be calculated, on the  right forefinger of the girl.  It was just a useless ceremony, but also an oath that symbolized eternity and commitment. \n\nYou did not need any words, one look, one action and you and your partner would understand what the other meant – even if the girl’s face was enough to obscure the brilliance of the stars, even if the girl’s body was able to cover the sky, even if her unconscious physiological actions were the equivalent of a natural disaster to the other civilizations. \n\nLove is able to overcome all,  \n\nAt least for Yaorong, these were not considered to be barriers, and the mountains and rivers could be crossed with a single step. The songs of praise that the citizens of the Empire used to sing for her had been rewritten to - §H “The Supreme one unfurls the sky-shading wings, and the entire star region will be shrouded in endless darkness, and the intense waves of high energy particles can be observed with the naked eyes. When She moves, the hyperspace channels change their routes, the planets collapses, and even the stars are afraid enough to curl up and retract their brilliance. This is the power that only befits Her supreme majesty. She used her own blood and bones to create the history of this entire universe.” §!\n\nNow, the supreme one who writes history, who uses her body to measures the world has also bowed before you."

gts_god_keeper.4011.desc: "§P “Actually, it is all a bit strange, isn't it?”\n\n“I am both your god, and your follower… Then, why can't I also be your non-blood related daughter, and your wife at the same time?” §!\n\nYaorong deliberately used her ring-laden hand to pick up her pure white veil. What was more eye catching than her decorated face was the thing that the girl was holding in her other hand. The girl's unlimited power had created a bouquet of flowers… a bouquet that was comparable to the size of the Empire’s homeworld.  \n\n§P  “Isn't that right~?” §!\n\nHer molten golden pupils were now fixed on you. Those eyes were always unrestrained in revealing her feelings, and today was no exception - joy, delight, excitement and also a hint of indescribable lust.\n\n§P “I finally got here today, Father…”§!\n\nThe Empire's flagship finally parked at the tip of Yaorong’s eyelashes. Those huge eyes, which were as big as satellites, looked so awe-inspiring, and so worthy of… adoration. However, whether it be awe or adoration, its aggressiveness was undeniable - if it was any other ordinary person, they could consider this stalking. \n\nYaorong’s gaze was inching down over your broad back.  A certain part of the girl’s heart was tingling and coupled with that, every pore on her body had opened up slightly as if she was savoring every inch of that body, which had once belonged to her, was now belonging to her again. The protectiveness which was brought out by that body's power had made the person who was being protected in her arm to either completely melt in it, or shiver in front of power that was enough to rewrite the world – and so, she thought, that  she should be rebellious. That she should slowly consume him from his firm exterior all the way to his soft and vulnerable inner self… Yes, she was unashamedly revealing her desire to devour you.\n\n§P “Father…”\n\n“Sometimes, I feel like a puppy. At the moment that you call my name and hug me tightly, I will respond to your call from that moment onwards, until we die... am I not just such a creature, one that has always focused on some event and some person. ”\n\n\"But I do feel like a puppy… puppies never hold a grudge no matter if you have locked them out for ten minutes or two hours.  Puppies only know that when you opened the door for them, they will protect you whenever you are in danger, no matter what. “ \n\n“Do you still remember the time, long ago when you were captured by the fleet of a foreign country?  Though this might be like making self-boasting claims, but I always do my best to come and save you whenever you are in danger… Isn’t that just like a puppy?” §!\n\nThe girl sounded a little excited, but seeing the sight of you quickly made her calm down."
gts_god_keeper.4011.a: "But you also sometimes act like a cat; because at the very least dogs will bother you to go outside for walks and play fetch using flying discs from time to time"
gts_god_keeper.4011.b: "Willing to protect you no matter what, but cats would just wait at home for you to go hunt things and then feed them when you're back"

gts_god_keeper.4012.desc: "§P  “But it can’t be helped, I am just simply drawn to these little things…. Father.” §!\n\nShe did not change that title that she had been using for so long. You also preferred to be called “father” than “husband” – although in the coming days, you two would more likely to refer to each other with the latter title.\n\n§P  “So, would you still want this puppy of yours?” §!\n\n§Y “A puppy will always be loyal, never betray.” §!\n\nYaorong was originally planning to do a pledge of loyalty to you, to show her loyalty with an everlasting  oath - she had even come up with the lines – §H “With the azure star as my lamp, and the Milky Way as my blade.  I will follow Father’s Kingdom straight to the other side of victory, until the end of all things to declare my unending loyalty.” §!\n\nBut at the end, she used the phrase of a puppy , because in front of you, she was truly like a puppy protecting its master.  \n\n§P “Of course.” §!\n\nYour heart had been settled, and you felt just as relaxed as someone who just found out that the one you were bonded to since youth was actually your childhood sweetheart – your little puppy wouldn’t be able to squeeze you dry right?. No way!"
gts_god_keeper.4012.a: "Yeah, couldn’t she…?"
gts_god_keeper.4013.desc: "The next moment, a crimson fleshy wall had become the entirety of your world.\n\nAt this moment, the heart that had previously settled into peace had now sunk into the abyss - at the very least, if you had met someone on a dating site you would’ve spoken of the life of Bach, the poems of Shira, or the sad fate of the universe heading towards heat death via increased entropy before finally showing their true goal to you and asking whether you wanted to stay at the nearby hotel that has a half-off on their couples room to talk about the meaning of life. However, your little one, your puppy, your wife, she had skipped straight to the final act: she had directly locked you up inside her.  \n\nIf nothing went wrong, then that would be her vulva. Which is where a liquid of love was flowing freely like a flood. If you were willing to calm down to see it, you might be able to clearly see the corroded warships and the broken remains of planets.  They were all a part of this world, with them being added to the terrifying and cruel color of this world.\n\nHowever, a terrifying world gave you another possibility. This was your child, wanting to give you rebirth… that’s right, she had previously said how “why can’t I be your daughter and wife at the same time”.\n\nShe was now going a step further… §H She was going to fulfill the duty as the mother god, she wanted to use her near psychopathic love to become your mother.§!\n\nThis cruel and murderous world was calling towards you - tread down this peak path, accept the love and promise from that supreme god, accept your second life, and go lie down like a child inside her womb……\n\nThere was no need to hesitate.\nYou chose to embrace a new life.
