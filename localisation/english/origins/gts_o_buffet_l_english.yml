  START_SCREEN_MESSAGES_PARASITIC_ROBOT: "After 42 cycles, our Creator ended her journey across the galaxy and settled in our current star system for a rest.\n\nBefore completely falling into sleep, determined not to let insects or hunger disturb her dreams, our Creator came up with a brilliant idea:\n\nUsing the planets in the star system as materials, with her vast intelligence and psionic power, she created our civilization on her belly.\n\nShe guided us to quickly build a full-fledged industrial and agricultural space-age system using the materials on her, to fill her belly during her rest and protect her body from defilement.\n\nTo help us grow quickly, our Creator psionically manifested an avatar, equal in stature with us, to represent her.\n\nHaving explained everything, she fell into slumber, continuing her afternoon nap."
  gts_chenghui.0.name: "Artificial Structures"
  gts_chenghui.0.desc: "Our aerial drones dispatched to scan the Creator's right foot reported anomalies, including numerous building remains within the big toe crevices. Preliminary analysis suggests these belong to humanoid structures. Chenghui has no memory of these bacterial-like colonies on her foot, necessitating further investigation of this unknown architecture."

  gts_chenghui.3000.name: "Initial Investigation"
  gts_chenghui.3000.desc: "These beings identify as humans, and our assessment unit states that they are not native to the Creator's foot but migrated here from other worlds.\n\nPreliminary inquiry indicates these buildings have stood for thousands of years. Judging by their construction technology, the civilization had reached a space-age level. What bewilders us is why these once functional settlements were abandoned, given no natural wear or unconscious damage noted. Moreover, we find no ancient life fossil remains in what should be ruins of their civilization, and even tombs thousands of years old are barren, with only deeply buried remnants surviving.\n\nExamining excavated relics reveals this species faced disastrous climate and disease during its city's founding, leading to mass mortality."
  CHENGHUIFOOT1: "Continue Investigation"
  gts_chenghui.3001.name: "Canyon"
  gts_chenghui.3001.desc: "While mining beneath the foot, numerous organic fossil remains were found. By comparison, they appear to belong to the same species as the toe builders.\n\nThese structures are notably primitive yet adorned with intricate patterns, depicting feminine sculptures in our Creator's likeness. We saw inscriptions recording ancestors' exiles, new settlements permitted by a benevolent goddess, cultivating the lands, and facing hardships. They as her pious subjects cleared heretics and prayed thrice daily, dedicating their lives to divine foot maintenance.\nHowever, when contacted, Chenghui had no recollection of such memories.\n\nLater inscriptions matching with the written language from toe ruins depicted crucifixes, crescent moons, and hexagrams. Followers of Earth's old religion recorded post-displacement struggles with resources, oppressive climate, famine, death, and societal collapse. Eventually, a new worship of the giantess erupted, engulfing dissidents who were exiled to devote themselves to foot maintenance duties while longing for their homeland.\n\nThe last inscription noted obligatory mining and painting monumental religious portraits for new converts throughout the canyon.\n\nSadly, none of their enormous artworks survived time and sweat."
  CHENGHUIFOOT2: "Remarkable"
  gts_chenghui.3002.name: "Flying"
  gts_chenghui.3002.desc: "Fragments were found between toenails, many comprising materials never observed on the Creator.\n\nThe rusty emblem 'UNUP-CAMELLIA (U.N. Ulysses Program - Camellia)' corroborates ancient records of a colony ship's crash, its scattered fragments landing in these crevices due to a remote impact.\n\nMore contemporary spacecraft debris showed assembly from foot excretions. Landing issues spanned design flaws to fuel shortages or simple post-mission disposal. It seems that over time and several attempts they re-learned to ascend to space.\n\nOn the big toe's peak, we found a small faded flag, engraved with 'For Goddess and People, 5269'."
  CHENGHUIFOOT3: "Inspiring"
  gts_chenghui.3003.name: "Summary"
  gts_chenghui.3003.desc: "Piecing together all gathered clues, we reconstruct a partial history of toe-dwelling humans.\n\nThousands of years ago, Earth's civilizations launched colony ships through a discovered unstable wormhole, hoping for pioneering cosmic travels. Camellia, one such ship, faced a dwindling search for an inhabitable planet. Nearing fuel exhaustion, a new wormhole took them to our Creator's foot vicinity, capturing the craft with its gravitational pull. With no fuel, the colony ship settled between this giantess's toes, establishing isolated foothold amidst thriving yet barren land.\n\nOur giantess Creator's body posed survival challenges for unprepared organics. Soon, resource scarcity, famine, and civil wars followed in dark ages. Despite devolving into a feudal era, humanity sturdily survived in the crevices. Stabilizing society saw old and new religious fervor clash, resulting in defeat and exile of old-religion adherents to foot maintenance roles. Through centuries of theocratic rule, science resurfaced and industrialization heralded a return to space.\n\nCountless generations later, surviving humanity masterminded homeward return upon reclaiming lost history and technology through collective decision. Colony ships were built, ancestors' remains exhumed and loaded with families aboard, with only a few hardliners staying. Humanity departed, embracing a broader cosmos but yearning for Earth.\n\nThe legacy of resettling a barren land to human-friendly and rejoining the stars spans three millennia. Today, humanity's descendants set foot on the road back to their ancestral homeland."
  CHENGHUIFOOT4: "Intriguing"
  gts_chenghui.3004.name: "Monument"
  gts_chenghui.3004.desc: "In an ancient edifice amidst sweat lakes, a monument was found preserved by automated systems and vacuum. Though weathered, translation rendered clear engravings:\n\n'From Earth we come.\n\nExhausted through arduous journeys, our ancestors were fortunate to encounter a benevolent goddess, settling upon her heavenly feet.\n\nInitial days were harsh, ship provisions fell short, forcing survival on saline lakes and discarded skin.\n\nInfighting fractured colonial unity, devastating scientific legacy.\n\nWe settled near saline seas, harvested dead skin, sought vital seeds, and mined toe-grime. Thus, struggling, we survived.\n\nBlame does not rest with Goddess; rather, we owe her gratitude for refuge. Her boundless resources spared us starvation.\n\nNow rejuvenated, we reclaimed our former glory-more advanced, with faster-than-light engines.\n\nOf bygone religious strife... we remain goddess-devout, free from extremist shackles. Historical truth fosters our cohesion.\n\nThousands of years of symbiosis mean naught to Goddess, oblivious to tiny beings sustained by toe effluence.\n\nFarewell, benevolent Goddess. We bid you a solemn prayer.\n\nHomeward we return.'"

Anyway, congratulations on having built a faster-than-light engine by yourselves. Achieving such progress as machines is indeed my proudest work.\nAh, apologies for not introducing myself. This psionic avatar is a full agent of my will. I call her Great Epoch Chenghui; just call her Chenghui.\nSoon, I will be in deep sleep, granting Chenghui higher consciousness autonomy, but remember, she remains as one with me, so don't wrong her or me."
  gts_chenghui.4001.a: "What is our task?"
  gts_chenghui.4001.a.response: "You must provide as much food as possible for me. Though I've tried to minimize my energy intake, this is still a considerable burden for you. Ensure you have enough food prepared; otherwise, I can't guarantee my actions upon waking hungry. Also, strengthen your military presence. Expansion is yours to decide, but it's paramount to protect my body from disturbances in my rest."
