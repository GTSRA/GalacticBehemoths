  origin_Jiju: "A.E.I.O.U."
  origin_Jiju_desc: "The rocket slowly ascends, marking another civilization entering the age of galactic competition.\nIn the panties and wombs of those jubilant girls, another colony of tinies is joyously celebrating as well."
  origin_Jiju_effect: "The true protagonists of this origin are the microscopic life forms, striving to make the girls of the world your colonies!"

  requires_not_Jiju: "Our citizens inexplicably reject bodily mechanization."
  living_standard_Jiju_assimilation: "Accept Colonization"
  living_standard_Jiju_assimilation_tooltip: "This species will gradually acquire the \"Microbial Inhabitation\" trait."

  living_standard_Jiju_assimilation_tooltip_delayed: "We will employ various methods from gentle persuasion to blackout maneuvers, allowing our friends inside us to seize the opportunity for colonization during \"close encounters\"."
  jiju_unity: "Mutual Aid Nation"
  jiju_unity_desc: "The positive attitude from both sides pulled the two civilizations back from the abyss. Their coordinated cooperation will bring more benefits to our alliance."
  jiju_destory: "Pure Nation"
  jiju_destory_desc: "We successfully eradicated the parasites trying to control our bodies. The decisive and firm decisions of our government are met with great satisfaction by society."
  jiju_destory_anti: "Stubborn Resistance"

  jiju_destory_anti_desc: "Some parasites still resist, taking citizens they control as hostages. It will take time to completely eliminate them."
  edict_gts_ronghe_inside: "Complete Integration"
  edict_gts_ronghe_inside_desc: "It's time. We can send the tinies, who have become sufficiently accustomed to the internal environment, into our bodies to start a new life. For this purpose, they need to be further miniaturized. Although we might never contact them again, it is all worth it!"

  gts_ronghe_inside_tooltip: "This decision will merge ten tinies with the Giantess Habitability trait into a giantess population, providing substantial bonuses.\n§YCooldown: 1 year§!"

  START_SCREEN_MESSAGES_JIJU: "Our civilization achieved remarkable scientific achievements long before our hosts gained consciousness, but our longstanding dream of space exploration made no progress. Our rockets were either blown away or crashed into passing animals. This forced us to acknowledge the catastrophic truth: our natural size will forever prevent us from reaching space.\n\nBut we found a solution: let those more giant beings achieve the grand galactic competition for us.\n\nAfter examining many potential species, we chose this one as our host. Their struggle became our struggle, as we provided them with enlightenment and physical enhancements. In return, as they traverse the globe and reach for the stars, they serve as our vessels to explore the world and proliferate across the seas."
  jiju_out_chain_title: "Strange Bodily Reaction"
  jiju_out_chain_desc: "People are discovering unusual sensations within their bodies..."
  jiju_out.1.name: "Rumors Abound"
  jiju_out.1.desc: "After achieving psychic awakening, our people began to feel something amiss. During meditation, they always sensed a large number of weak and concentrated psychic reactions in their lower abdomen, which clearly didn't originate from themselves, more like... someone resides there. Our psychics are conducting psychic ceremonies to verify this theory through psychic links."
  jiju_out.2.desc: "Following the completion of the first genetic editing experiment, our citizens felt something amiss. Their bodies, sensitized from the genetic modification surgery, seemed always aware of a persistent itch in the vagina, akin to... someone residing inside. Our scientists are researching this phenomenon, confident that we'll soon verify this claim."
  gts_aeiou.1.a: "Is that so?"

  gts_aeiou.1.b: "This is serious!"
  situation_tinys_out_crsis: "Internal Tenant"
  situation_tinys_out_crsis_desc: "This accidental discovery has unveiled the secret of interdependence between two species for millennia. Both the giantesses and the tinies residing within them feel uneasy about the potential developments of this event, making the crisis response by the governments exceptionally crucial."
