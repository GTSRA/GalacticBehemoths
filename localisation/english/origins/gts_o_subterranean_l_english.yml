  origin_gts_subterranean: "Sole Dwellers"
  origin_gts_subterranean_desc:1 "A pair of massive boot-socks from an unknown giantess have deeply pierced into the crust of nearly half a planet, and the vast space within the boots has become a home for a certain species. The real reason why this species chose to live in this harsh environment is difficult to ascertain. Perhaps it was to escape natural disasters, perhaps to obtain resources, or perhaps they evolved from the microorganisms within the boots. In any case, the species has adapted and even become fascinated with this dark, humid, and foot-scented environment during their evolution, creating a social structure with a stronger adaptability to this environment."

  origin_tooltip_gts_subterranean_effects:3 "-Starts with the §HBoot Dweller§! trait\n-Mining districts provide 3 housing\n-Your species builds cities underground, granting these advantages:\n\n"
  gts_amazing_sweat: "Abundant Foot Detritus"
  gts_amazing_sweat_desc: "The former owner of these boots may have used them for a long time, or perhaps they were prone to sweating, as the foot detritus inside shows no signs of depletion even after tens of thousands of years of mining by the boot dwellers. This foot detritus, rich in high-grade minerals, is without a doubt the source of this civilization's prosperity."
  gts_lost_contact: "Lost Contact"
  gts_lost_contact_desc: "The lack of tribute to the socked foot leaves us disoriented. Homesickness and acclimatization rapidly spread among the confused masses. It is best if we quickly build the §YSock Foot Sanctuary§! and appoint at least one §YSock Foot Priest§! to meet the needs of the people."
  gts_among_shadow: "Among the Shadows"
  gts_among_shadow_desc: "Sunlight is rare for us. The people living on the sock may see an hour or two of sunshine each day, while the residents deep inside the boot spend their entire lives exploring the boot world accompanied only by artificial light. This fills the inhabitants of this planet with awe of the world they live in... even if it is just a boot-sock left on this planet by a certain giantess."
  gts_planet_ruin: "Ecological Destruction"

  gts_planet_ruin_desc: "The giant boot's crustal fissures covering half the planet and the warm gases constantly emanating from the boot opening have nearly destroyed the planet's ecosystem. Even though the thick boot walls block most natural disasters from us, the productivity and inhabitation of the planet are still slightly affected."
  building_gts_foot_clean_mineral: "Foot Care Center"
  building_gts_foot_clean_mineral_desc: "Although other giantesses in the galaxy are not as massive as the owner of the boots on our homeworld, they are still large enough for us to excel. We will use our professional skills to serve visiting giantesses, and while cleaning their feet, we can also process the cleaned foot detritus."
  building_gts_holy_foot_temple: "Sock Foot Sanctuary"
  building_gts_holy_foot_temple_desc: "Life within the boots and socks has made us deeply dependent on this sacred environment, and thus we are filled with reverence for the silken foot and even this nameless goddess. This faith is unrelated with ideology, as no matter where we are, only this familiar scent can soothe us."
  job_gts_foot_prist: "Sock Foot Priest"
  job_gts_foot_prist_plural: "Sock Foot Priests"
  job_gts_foot_prist_desc: "These priests are usually popular opinion leaders who are responsible for spreading the beauty of the socked foot to the whole society and coordinating disputes between the black silk faction, the white silk faction, the cotton sock faction, and the bare foot faction."

  d_foot_dirt_ringworld_desc: "Some of the sweat stains left by the original owner of the toe ring have gradually dried under the long-term irradiation of the star, forming the diverse terrain of this world and bringing rich mineral deposits."

  d_gts_footdirt: "Foot Detritus"
  d_gts_footdirt_desc: "The metabolic waste products of the former owner's of the boots' feet. These god-given high-quality minerals have built our vast industrial empire."
  d_gts_footsweat_1: "Dense Sweat Mist"
  d_gts_footsweat_1_desc: "This area is covered by a highly concentrated foot sweat mist with low visibility, making it extremely easy to get lost in mist or crash on sock."
  d_gts_footsweat_2: "Warm Sweat Mist"
  d_gts_footsweat_2_desc: "After massive sweat mist condensation, the foot sweat concentration in this area has decreased significantly, which allows us to further develop into the boot interior"
  d_gts_sock_1: "Lint Balls"
  d_gts_sock_1_desc: "These soft, starchy lints are about the size of an asteroid. Coming from socks hanging high in the boot. They occasionally fall to the ground, which, while causing a lot of trouble, often adds a rich mineral deposit to the surrounding cities."
  d_gts_sock_2: "Socks"
  d_gts_sock_2_desc: "The bottom of these socks was once thought to be the end of the sky, until rockets sent us above this gray sky. Today, people make industrial products by collecting loose fibers from the socks, while government departments use the socks to regulate the temperature and rainfall inside the boot."
  d_gts_boot: "Flat Boot Sole"

  d_gts_boot_desc: "The solid foundation of the empire's capital, with salty springs or steam still seeping out from the holes in the boot sole from time to time."
  START_SCREEN_GTS_SUBTERRANEAN:1 "While other life on [GetHomeWorldName] must endure the night in the wilderness, our ancestors quickly learned the wisdom of living within this massive boot. These giant boot-socks provided shelter from the harsh sunlight and severe climate.\n\n$START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_END$"
  START_SCREEN_GTS_SUBTERRANEAN_PLANT:1 "Life on [GetHomeWorldName] took some completely different paths of evolution. Unlike the other life forms on our world, they draw energy from the sun, while we derive nourishment from nutrient-rich detritus, just as our [GetSpeciesAdj] ancestors did.\n\n$START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_END$"
  START_SCREEN_GTS_SUBTERRANEAN_LITHOID: "We were born in the detritus of the massive boot of [GetHomeWorldName]. Our evolutionary path is different from our immobile cousins, who watch us like sentinels from above, while we have chosen to stay away from the harsh and radiant sunlight. Unlike them, we gained the ability to move, think, and build a civilization.\n\n$START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_END$.\n\n$START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_END$"
  START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_GTS_END:1 "The easily accessible high-quality minerals within the boot-socks allowed our [GetSpeciesAdj] ancestors to industrialize, unite our species, and deepen the boot-dwelling form of civilization. We have tried to return to the surface several times, but each time, it only brought back harsh and difficult memories. Therefore, we have remained underground, building our supreme position on the solid and sacred boot soles.\n\nNow, with the discovery of the faster-than-light engine, we are making our boldest attempt to reach the stars-and like our ancestors, we shall carve out our own home in the darkness."
