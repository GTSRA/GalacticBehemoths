  origin_ultra_road: "Path to Godhood"
  origin_ultra_road_desc: "We cannot discern the true intentions of this civilization. What we know is that their emergence is an unprecedented calamity for the entire universe. Their massive bodies will overwhelm anything in their path. Now they are viewed as an absolute disaster by the other civilizations of the galaxy. When other civilizations encounter them, will they submit at their feet, or will they fight to the death?"
  origin_ultra_road_effect: "- This species possesses a §RCelestial-level body size§!.\n- Starting planet is always located on the outskirts of the system, and is unable to communicate properly with other nations.\n- Special population and building systems.\n\n- §SThis origin cannot communicate with any civilization through normal means. Only destruction is the only destiny for these galactic maggots!§!"

  START_SCREEN_MESSAGES_ULTRA_ROAD: "§SIt is unknown when it began, but our people began to yearn for the sky, the boundless sky. We imagined flying freely among the heavens, plucking stars from the sky to adorn our loved ones’ heads!§!\n\nOur limitless lifespans had made us forget time over these long years, so much so that we almost forgot the dream of reaching the sky, until one day a small, model-like spaceship arrived on this planet a hundred years ago. Our people sensed them and went to investigate. The creatures from within came out from small doors in flying devices. As we watched them, we saw fear, confusion, even joy in their thoughts. We thought them to be guests from the sky, and thus dispatched diplomats to communicate with them. The reply we received, however, was that they intended to occupy this planet, enslaving our friends and family. Furious, we killed them all and surrounded that model-like spaceship.\n\nOur technicians deciphered the information from the ship and learned that it was their largest type of colonial exploration ship, a massive vessel over 100 kilometers across, yet barely capable of filling the palm of our hand.\n\nOur technicians dismantled the ship, and our scientists researched the ship's technology night and day, studying its contents – the biology, food, supplies etc.\n\nWe interpreted much from their databases, including information about this system, this planet. The data was even more complete than the latest data in our own best databases. The technology alone would be enough for us to advance several eras, and this was merely from a small colony ship.\n\nHowever, this discovery not only brought joy of a larger world, but also disquieting information. Before we killed them, they sent out visuals and distress signals. We don’t know if their nation received these, but we feel that war will come soon.\n\nHowever, reality diverged greatly from imagination. When we first established our planet's first regular military force, we realized how laughable our enemies were. The weapons created using their technology were completely useless - not that those weapons were useless, but that the enemy was unworthy of their use. Of the tens of thousands of warships that descended from the sky, none of them were even larger than our weapon's caliber. Our warriors only realized they were under attack after several minutes, and as to why they had ignored it, it was because their attacks barely registered on their skin.\n\nSo our soldiers put down their weapons and playfully toyed with these weak, dust-like creatures using their own bodies.\n\nIn mere minutes, a handful of soldiers had completely annihilated their “Elite Extermination Fleet”, and even a drop of water dripping from our soldiers’ crotches could destroy hundreds of warships.\n\nSince then, we have never seen more alien beings arrive on this planet. Instead, a multitude of threats and intimidations frequently appeared in our sight. Countless insults, threats, reproaches and extinction declarations flooded our unprotected world.\n\nWe felt a strong sense of aversion and wished to kill all of them and turn them into dust on our bodies. Therefore, we do not want any communication with any countries, only the annihilation or enslavement of all life in the universe.\n\nAt the same time, we made a major breakthrough in our aerospace technology. According to our research and inventions, we have built exploration ships. These advanced ships, which do not need to be controlled by the giantesses directly, but through the hyperspace network, were immediately sent to space to explore those unknown but familiar territories.\n\nThus, that peaceful race, which only looked up to the sky, was annihilated completely by an invading fleet.\n\n§RLeaving behind only a Giantess Empire that is solely devoted to destruction and enslavement.§!"

Now, we have the ability to roam in this sea of stars.\n\nIn the midst of waiting, our first research ship, equipped with a hyperspace engine, took off from the Atlas Launch Site. Thirty minutes later, it left the planet's gravity well and arrived in this cluster of stars. It will be our first step out, and after that, there will be many steps waiting for us to take.

After our educators arrested and educated hundreds of fanatic entertainment enthusiasts, they completely accepted our new definition, which is:\n\n'Restricted entertainment, unrestricted slaughter'.\n\nWe are steadily moving to the next stage, the new order will establish a better galaxy!"
  gts_ultra_road.321.a: "That's more like it."

  gts_ultra_road.322.desc: "Ah, the last batch of elements has also been arrested, but unfortunately, as stubborn partisans, they are unlikely to accept the control of the law. But the darkness of the galaxy encompasses everything, doesn't it, adult?\n\nThey will soon be selected by the navy and participate in operations as independent extermination fleets. Their superb destruction skills will destroy all obstacles of the enemy at an extremely fast pace. And at this moment, our empire can be said to have completely entered a new era, a new future led by order!"

Whether they accept or not, everything will be under our rule. Those who are hostile to us can only be reduced to dust!"

  gts_ultra_road.324.desc: "We have formulated a number of policies that are beneficial to the people, and at the same time, we have obtained considerable data through the implementation of these policies. I think that in the near future, we will surely make the order we have established as boundless as the vast universe."
  gts_ultra_road.324.a: "Not bad."
  gts_ultra_road.325.name: "Popular Support"
  gts_ultra_road.325.desc: "We have implemented all our policies, and now everyone can get an equal number of toys and the same high-quality game experience.\n\nAlso, our policies for the galaxy, and our plans for the future of the entire sky are all on this piece of paper. And now, it’s time to announce our true existence, isn’t it, adult?"
  gts_ultra_road.325.a: "Our order, our rule, the true future of the galaxy."
  gts_ultra_road.325.b: "A great future requires a solid past as its foundation, it is still too early."
  gts_ultra_road.326.name: "Universal Broadcast"
  gts_ultra_road.326.desc: "We will achieve victory and glory, and you will eventually be reduced to dust.\n\nYou will only get endless darkness and sacrifice, while we will gain the entire splendid sky!\n\nSubmit to us. We will allow you, the bacteria, to survive in the darkest corners of the galaxy. Otherwise, all that awaits you bacteria is the end and death!"
  gts_ultra_road.326.a: "We will spread the light of victory to the entire sea of stars."
  gts_ultra_road.327.name: "Universal Broadcast"
  gts_ultra_road.327.desc: "A few years ago, we were still naive, but now, our power has already made the galaxy tremble.\n\nLet us raise high the banner of galactic unification and destroy those maggots and ants along with their filthy nests.\n\nAnd our light of order will radiate a brilliance far exceeding that of the stars, illuminating the entire galaxy!\n\nWe are bound to achieve the glory of victory, and they can only obtain the end and death!"

  gts_ultra_road.327.a: "The time has come."

  gts_ultra_road.400.name: "Prelude to War"
  gts_ultra_road.400.desc: "Our troops have gathered on the border, hundreds of battleships are ready to go. Those bugs' countries have not yet noticed our intentions.\n\nWe should crush them mercilessly, shouldn't we?\n\nJust like that, let's drive our troops into their borders!"
  gts_ultra_road.400.a: "Advance! Crush the enemy before our eyes! Sow our order in their blood!"
  gts_ultra_road.410.name: "Overture to Extinction"
  gts_ultra_road.410.desc: "Listen, even from here, I can hear the roars and screams of those bugs, like the most beautiful music, surrounding my ears.\n\nLook, even from here, I can see those ants trying to save their nests, reluctant tears, and hateful blood, watering the barren land. They forged our greatness with their bodies, it is so touching."
  gts_ultra_road.410.a: "I think they must've been so worried about my future progression and advancement, I can't let them down!"
  gts_ultra_road.410.b: "What good and obedient little fellows, I really wish I could grab ther leaders so that they can massage my feet well~"
  gts_ultra_road.411.name: "The First Act of Fire"
  gts_ultra_road.411.desc: "Look, the enemy’s territory is burning like fireworks. What is burning, are their people, their land, their blood.\n\nLike firewood, they stubbornly oppose us with hot blood, and die with humiliation, those pathetic little fellows.\n\nIf they could accept our proposal and completely become our slaves, none of this would have happened, right?\n\nIt's just a pity that their incompetent and arrogant government attempted to fight us, as if death had nothing to do with them. However, it is outrageous to waste our precious human resources of the empire like this, adult. Allow us to destroy the capital of those arrogant bugs, or do you have other plans?"
  gts_ultra_road.411.a: "Destroy them, the carrion-eating maggots are not worth our wasting too much time."
  gts_ultra_road.411.b: "I think my retinue needs a certain degree of expansion, and they just fit the bill."
  gts_ultra_road.412.name: "The Second Movement of the Finale"
  gts_ultra_road.412.desc: "Hmm~ The king of the maggots is howling, lamenting the collapse of their fragile dynasty. How delightful, isn’t it?\n\nTheir failure is so complete and just proves the importance of our order to the galaxy.\n\nSince our path is absolutely correct, let this dirty and disgusting civilization disappear completely in time!"
  gts_ultra_road.412.a: "Destroy them, just consider it as a reward."
  gts_ultra_road.412.b: "Give them to you as toys, they have already been proven to be powerless anyway."
  gts_ultra_road.413.name: "Interlude of Victory"
  gts_ultra_road.413.desc: "The lair of the bugs is completely destroyed under our attack. Our light of order will eventually spread to the entire galaxy. This is an inevitable result. However, the establishment of order takes time, and our troops also need to rest. And on those planets that are still on the border, unaffected by war, there are many supplies and toys~.\n\nOur troops should be able to draw a part of the population from them to meet the increasing demand of our troops, what do you think about that?"
  gts_ultra_road.413.a: "Approved, remember to 'spare some' for me too."

  gts_ultra_road.413.b: "It is useless to leave them, I will leave the decision to you."
  gts_ultra_road.420.name: "After the War"
  gts_ultra_road.420.desc: "Adult, it seems our small people inventory is a little insufficient, right? I see some empires have recently been unruly. The members of the maggot council are also strongly condemning our 'inhumane care' and 'waste of cosmic resources’ practices, hmm~ it’s time to teach them a lesson, isn’t it?\n\nOur fleet has rested for a considerable amount of time since the last battle. They have been looking forward to experiencing what fresh slaves feel like. Give the order to spread the glorious light of order, adult!"
  gts_ultra_road.420.a: "I also want to replace a batch of my servants, go and let them capture some for me~"

  gts_ultra_road.421.desc: "That miserable empire, along with their dust-like leader, opposed our proposal with fairness and order, they are truly unappreciative.\n\nNow, our fleet has arrived at the borderline, and the second chapter of the symphony named war has also begun.\n\nCome on, adult, they are all waiting for your baton to drop and play this movement called war together!"
  gts_ultra_road.421.a: "Come, let us play this grand movement together!"
  gts_ultra_road.422.name: "A Concert of Glory and Death"
  gts_ultra_road.422.desc: "As in the first act, the melodious music resounds over the entire galaxy. Their weak forces are like a wall of sand in front of us, oh no, it should be that we feel absolutely nothing, like air~\n\nOur troops have arrived outside their capital, astronomical numbers have gradually lost their meaning for us, after all, no matter how far, it seems to take only a moment for us to arrive.\n\nSoon, this country surrounded by barbarism and stupidity will welcome our order to manage and teach them."
  gts_ultra_road.422.a: "The taste of victory is so sweet."
  gts_ultra_road.422.b: "The performance of the music is about to reach a small climax, let us make this performance more wonderful."
  gts_ultra_road.423.name: "A Small Climax in the Music"
  gts_ultra_road.423.desc: "We have broken through their capital, destroying everything they were proud of, all those absurd, ridiculous, meaningless things.\n\nAnd we have brought the radiance of order to this ruin. Rebuilding will start now. Because the weak government of their nation has already surrendered to us... no, it should be a slave to us, right ~ \n\nIn short, this ordinary war has once again come to an end with our crushing victory. And those planets that need to be rebuilt, adult, what are you going to do?"
  gts_ultra_road.423.a: "Isn't the reserve of small things ever more scarce, is this not the best breeding ground?"
  gts_ultra_road.423.b: "The planets in the inventory seem to be a bit scarce. I broke many of them last time. Hand over all those planets to my collection. I have my own ways."
  gts_ultra_road.424.name: "An Interlude of War, or Perhaps the Beginning of Another Movement"
  gts_ultra_road.424.desc: "Since we conquered the second empire, that group called the Galactic Council has changed its previous attitude and began to actively engage in diplomacy with us, and invited us to become a permanent primary council member of the Galactic Council. Should we agree to their generous offer, or should we use our own means to solve future diplomatic problems?"
  gts_ultra_road.424.a: "There is no harm in joining them. Besides, those bugs seem to recognize this thing very much. I don't know how much profit we can get from it in the future."
  gts_ultra_road.424.b: "The bugs' council wants us to manage them? What a joke! We do not need to be invited! The light of order can illuminate the entire galaxy without these things!"
