  origin_Aya: "Aya the Colorful Princess and the Seven Hundred Million Tinies"
  origin_Aya_desc: "§RThis origin is quite challenging!§!\nThis nation unified the entire planet early in the space era and built a prosperous global metropolis that dwarfed even faster-than-light civilizations. However, a severe FTL experiment accident shrank the world’s population while enlarging a girl named Maruyama Aya into a giantess thousands of meters tall."
  origin_Aya_effect: "Start the game with an urban world as your home planet, using the §Y'Tiny'§! trait for the primary species and a powerful giantess leader.\nNo guaranteed habitable planets.\nDue to the sudden shrinking of the population, you will have more initial resources."
  Aya_sol_system_initializer_NAME: "Solar System (Aya Origin)"

  Aya_sol_system_initializer_DESC: "Go play Bandori.jpg"
  aya_end_of_golden_age: "Chaos of the Post-Golden Age"
  aya_end_of_golden_age_desc: "Although the disaster happened long ago, its scars have yet to heal. The leap in technology short-term cannot reverse the decline in productivity, with the shrinking of people causing almost all industrial facilities to halt, many reverting to bartering. A pessimistic atmosphere spreads among the tinies, with a widespread belief this is the end of the Golden Age. What can a towering girl with divine powers do?"
  aya_protect_us: "Aya Will Protect Us"
  aya_protect_us_desc: "To protect the home planet and those who support and rely on her, Maruyama Aya will strive to protect this world. Be it through enemy bombings, land armies, or the ruthless flames of a colossus, she remains resolute."

  aya_slowly_order_restoration: "Rebuilding Order"
  aya_slowly_order_restoration_desc: "Many tinies indulge excessively after moving into their villas, causing significant trouble for local law enforcement and resource allocation. If we want to avoid yet another shrinking, we must curtail this behavior quickly."

  edict_Aya_Repression: "Strong Measures"

  edict_Aya_Repression_desc: "Blind tolerance will only lead to the loss of national authority.

  d_Aya_palace: "circle"
  d_Aya_palace_desc: "The Live House circle, repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, couldn’t escape being blown up during the onset of the calamity.

  d_Aya_footprint_mining: "Maruyama Agro-Industrial Complex"
  d_Aya_footprint_mining_desc: "Under Aya Maruyama's proposal and assistance, we established mining areas in her footprints to extract underground minerals and the crushed city ruins, planting crops in her arch. Now it has turned into an important agricultural and resource area of this planet."
  d_Aya_flat: "Rehearsal Zone"

  d_Aya_flat_desc: "Aya Maruyama rehearses in city ruins far from settlements, unknowingly attracting tinies willing to risk it all to watch their idol closely, gathering precious survival resources from the crushed debris."

  START_SCREEN_MESSAGES_AYA: "We received a ticket to the star river, but at what cost? With many cities abandoned, the government stalled, social order failing, and people hiding in corners scavenging supplies at the risk of being eaten by animals. We look up to our new leader, hoping she’ll lead us out of misery.\n\nWhat was the girl who became our deity like before the cataclysm? An unknown mini-idol? A high school girl working everywhere, only knowing how to repair cars and break tiles? We do not know, but now we can only depend on her."

Perhaps we can learn from its origins, even finding a way to recover.\n\nAny §YBiology§! technology unrelated to food production will contribute to your species' recovery progress. Some biology technologies provide additional progress, with §YGene Ascension§! significantly accelerating progress."
  situation_aya_tinys_change_type: "Investigate the Calamity"
  situation_aya_tinys_change_monthly_change_tooltip: "Our chosen strategy will dictate the progress rate of this §Ysituation§!."

  GET_SMALLER: "...Then Just Get Smaller"

  GET_SMALLER_DESC: "After the initial chaos ended, we realized how much fortune enough resources can be for a civilization's prosperity, though unprepared shrinking caused our woes.\nWith Aya Maruyama's suggestion and collective voting, scientists will use our biological discoveries to prepare for the citizens' second shrinking, while Aya helps us clear a secure shelter where billions of meticulously designed micro-cities will be deployed. Under our idol leader’s protection, a prosperous and blissful utopia is within reach."
  gts_aya.11.name: "Origin Explanation"
  gts_aya.11.desc: "The leader of this origin is inspired by one of the main singers from the rhythm game \"BanGDream!\", Aya Maruyama. Initially, the plan was to use another cute and endearing protagonist, Kasumi Toyama, but Aya's endearing nature (indicating being pitied) led to her selection as the protagonist."
  gts_aya.11.a: "Ayaya is so cute~"
  aya_returns.1.name: "Reversion of Size?"
  aya_returns.1.desc: "Long-term accumulation of biological knowledge finally bears fruit. Our scientists have proposed a bold plan: although we still lack the ability to revert our leader to normal size, we might be able to restore our species through genetic tailoring. This news is exhilarating, though some fear the size change could hit the empire’s economy as hard as the cataclysm did, with hostile nations possibly seizing the opportunity to attack."
  gts_aya.2.a: "In that case..."
  gts_aya.2.b: "We cannot risk the entire nation and population's fate; maintaining the status quo is safer."

  gts_aya.3.a: "Hooray!"
  aya_returns.2.name: "Project Complete"
  aya_returns.2.desc: "We not only readily accepted the challenge fate presented but also mastered physical adaptation. This adjusted size fits the cosmic realm better. Thanks to pre-prepared micro-cities globally, the adjustment didn’t impact society as the previous occurrence did. Without the efforts of our beloved giant Aya and countless scientists, our rebirth wouldn't have been possible."
  gts_aya.4.a: "Hooray!"
