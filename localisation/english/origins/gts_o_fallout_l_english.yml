  origin_gts_fallout: "Fallout"
  origin_gts_fallout_desc: "This civilization fell in the flames of a global nuclear war when taking the last step towards planetary unification. While the surviving survivors struggled to rebuild civilization, the overflowing radiation and artificial viruses in the atmosphere transformed these girls into something they had never imagined."
  origin_gts_fallout_effect: "- Starts with a tomb world as their homeworld.\n- Starting population reduced to 8.\n- New planet edicts enabled.\n- Prolonged exposure to radiation will provide your founder species with certain §Yunexpected§! effects."
  gts_radiation_army: "Radiation Armored Mech Girl"

  gts_radiation_army_desc: "The negligible radiation intensity for the giantesses is lethal to the little people, so... eat my nuclear surge!"
  d_gts_iss: "International Space Station"
  d_gts_iss_desc: "This is an outpost of the former civilization's conquest of space, where thousands of staff members were lucky enough to avoid the earth-shattering nuclear war. They now maintain an awkward and subtle cooperative relationship with their giant counterparts on their homeworld."
  d_gts_frozen_human: "Underground Cryo-Chamber"
  d_gts_frozen_human_desc: "This hidden underground cryo-chamber contains thousands of former civilization residents who underwent cryo treatment for disease. Perhaps when we have sufficient resources, we can awaken and treat these visitors from the past. Our appearance might be quite a surprise (or shock) to them."
  d_gts_fallout_settlement: "Giantess Settlement"
  d_gts_fallout_settlement_desc: "These scattered settlements were established by some peace-loving giantesses. Cooperation with these villages has provided much help for our country's reconstruction. While they are not very resistant to the new government, we still have a long way to go with lobbying if we want to truly integrate these villages."
  d_gts_fallout_raider: "Giantess Nomad"

  d_gts_fallout_raider_desc: "Some survivors, after discovering they grew into giantesses, use their physical advantages to wander among various urban ruins, taking pleasure in destroying cities and playing with the surviving little people - if there are any left. In addition, they resist the new government's command, which has brought us a lot of trouble."

  START_SCREEN_MESSAGES_Fallout: "The moment the air raid alarm sounded, our dream of prosperous unification and advancing into space was shattered.\n\nIn the beginning, we spent our days in sadness and fear. Radioactive fallout, unknown viruses, and the chaos of anarchy claimed the lives of our compatriots every day. We could only cower in subways, basements, and air-raid shelters until our bodies burst through these shelters in our sleep.\n\nWhether it was a conspiracy of a secret laboratory or a blessing from heaven, our genes showed traits of rapid growth in this environment, allowing us to clean up the ruins of the old world and rebuild order as soon as possible.\n\nNow we have accomplished what our predecessors failed to do. Thanks to the restoration of communication with the International Space Station, our scientific technology has quickly returned to pre-war levels. We stand here, feeling the pain, and gazing at the starry sky."

  gts_fallout.2.a: "Welcome home, little compatriots"
  gts_fallout.3.name: "Cryo-Chamber Unlocked!"
  gts_fallout.3.desc: "Although the nuclear war caused our technology to regress severely, it is not difficult for us to solve the diseases of their era. The main problem is how to explain to these tiny visitors from the past the huge changes that have taken place in our species and our home planet over the past few hundred years. Fortunately, with the unremitting efforts of both sides, they have finally struggled to understand our changes, which to them are like a fairy tale. Now they are studying the knowledge of the past few hundred years in specially built shelters and are conditioning their bodies to adapt to this very different world."
