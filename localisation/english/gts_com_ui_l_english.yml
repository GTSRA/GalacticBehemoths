  gts_ui.1.name: "\"A Stroll\""
  gts_ui.1.desc: "The unusual earthquake tonight has continued for a long time, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, but this does not seem like the short and continuous vibrations experienced before, but rather a very regular and sustained vibration, which puts the entire city in an atmosphere of panic and confusion.\n\nHowever, as the vibrations continue to intensify, dark shadows appearing on the horizon can be seen from the city, constantly approaching the city, and gradually becoming clearer under the moonlight. When this shadow is about 100 kilometers away from the city, the little people in the city can finally see the full picture of this shadow.\n\nIt is [Root.GetName]'s [root.GetRulerName].\n\nThe earthquake that started a few hours ago was caused by [root.GetRulerName]'s walking. She is \"strolling\" with a body size 100,000 times that of the local little people, and thanks to the high urbanization of this planet, each of [root.GetRulerName]'s steps accurately landed in the little people's city.\n\nAlthough the residents of this planet had just witnessed a few days ago how [Root.GetName]'s giantesses overwhelmingly destroyed the planet's defenses, the giantesses who landed at that time were only between a thousand and ten thousand times larger. The current size difference of 100,000 times still caused chaos in this city. Countless little people fled in the opposite direction of [root.GetRulerName], with car accidents and stampedes constantly occurring. It seems that even without [root.GetRulerName] stepping down, this city has completely lost its function.\n\nIt's a pity that [root.GetRulerName] had already grown tired of this scene a few hours ago. No city is not in chaos because of her arrival. Perhaps if this city had orderly evacuated its residents, [root.GetRulerName] may have spared it and mercifully passed it by.  [root.GetRulerName] lifted her right foot towards the city. The city debris constantly falling from under her stockings evidenced the results of her work in the past few hours. Putting her heel in the suburbs of the city, her sole enveloped the entire city. After wiggling her five toes a few times, her huge foot came down and then lifted again.  The screams of the little people in the city rose and fell with this movement. With the help of enhanced hearing, [root.GetRulerName] could clearly hear the voices of the little people underfoot.\n\nThis difference in size satisfies [root.GetRulerName] very much. One hand began to caress her private parts through her long skirt, but after a few times, [root.GetRulerName] also got tired of this game. As the number of times increased, the screams of the little people became smaller and smaller, which gradually made [root.GetRulerName] feel bored.  When the little people thought that this giant foot would lift up like before, this time the giant foot did not stop but stepped on the city unreservedly. The sounds under the foot also disappeared, and everything returned to silence with a dull rumbling sound.\n\n\"Ah, is this the last city? I knew I should have played with them a bit more.\"\n\n[root.GetRulerName] looked at the phone in her hand, and found that all the little people gathering places on the planet that could be considered city-level had been consumed in her few hours of \"strolling\". She looked at the huge footprint under her feet with lingering interest.\n\n\"Then let's go find something else, I still have a lot of time left.\""

They can freely alter their size to meet the needs of a giantess. Not only are they versatile, but also exceptionally affordable. \n\nXiaoyu possesses extensive experience in nipple service. By shrinking them to the appropriate size and placing them beside your nipple, then issuing a command, they will expertly stimulate your nipple through caressing, licking, and even burrow into your mammary duct, knead from within, and bring the most suitable tingling sensation. To enrich your experience, you can issue shameful commands such as making them call your nipple “master,” as well as verbal abuse, thus spurring even greater vigor and enthusiasm from this subservient individual. You'll also receive the utmost praise and gratitude from this little person, who adores you like a fool. Unlike other diminutive individuals, their ability to resurrect enhances their cost-effectiveness and enables them to provide an even deeper cleaning service. This includes the usual between the fingers and toes, but you can even shrink them and stick them onto your anal orifice like a deodorant, while their soft tongue cleanses your orifice of impurities. You can then simply stomp them to death afterward or command them to take their own life; their resurrection mechanism allows for maximum convenience. \n\nWhen not needed for the above services, you can enable Xiaoyu’s daily routine mode, causing them to revert to a cute, emotionally-reserved shota to take care of your everyday needs. After a busy day, you only need to call out while lying in bed, and Xiaoyu will come immediately to undress you. They will innocently and softly remove your undergarments with their mouth, kneeling at your feet to lick your toes, and will provide the desired feedback as they roll their tongue on your toes according to your preference. Moreover, if you have special types of play you wish to explore, Xiaoyu will shrink to your desired size and willingly cooperate with whatever game or rough treatment you want to inflict, even sacrificing their life without hesitation for your enjoyment. \n\nPlease believe me, that aside from being unable to heighten your great and sacred flavor with more pleasure, Xiaoyu is undoubtedly the most perfect shota you can buy."

 # 梦对她而言仍旧是太过遥远的事。她空望着无际的黑暗，身体和灵魂在忆质的重压之下早已到达崩溃的临界点。即使察觉到自己的意识逐渐远去，脑海中仍旧只有那些残存的记忆一遍遍重演——\n\n遮天蔽日的虫群冲破前线，她包裹在火焰中朝向虫群飞去，虫群的灰烬如雪般飘落，下面尽是骑士们漆黑的残骸。\n\n她还来不及手捧花束，为一位又一位牺牲的铁骑献上最后的纪念。他们的生命瞬息绽放，旋即熄灭，就像一串基因编码，只有数字，未曾拥有自己的姓名。

Even sensing her consciousness fading, only remnant memories replay in her mind—\n\nThe Swarm covering the sky broke the frontline. Wrapped in flames, she flew towards the Swarm. Ashes of the Swarm fell like snow, below were only black wreckage of knights.\n\nShe had no time to hold a bouquet, offering final remembrance for sacrificed knights one by one. Their lives bloomed instantly, then extinguished, like a genetic code, only numbers, never possessing their own names."
