  ap_space_gts: "Space Shipgirls"
  ap_space_gts_desc: "In our wars with alien races, we have gradually discovered that differences in body size between races have a much larger impact on space naval battles than we had imagined.\nFleets of giant races are invincible but extremely expensive to build, and their combat efficiency is also low; fleets of tiny races can easily enter enemy command modules through gaps to launch sneak attacks, but in most cases, they will be inadvertently crushed in various places.\nWe can change our thinking, from \"producing ships for warriors\" to \"turning ships into warriors\".\nPerhaps we can call these sentient ships \"Shipgirls\"?"
  add_research_options_space_gts: "Unlocks Shipgirl Destroyers and related tech tree."
  gts_ap_shipgirl.1.name: "The Shipgirl Project"
  gts_ap_shipgirl.1.desc: "In interstellar wars with varying body sizes, we gradually realize that relying solely on conventional firepower cannot compete with those more powerful beings. Even magnificent battleships tens of kilometers long are nothing more than toys that can be grasped and kneaded at will by Celestial-level giantesses.\n\nTherefore, a decisive project will now be put on our agenda – the largest fleet in the history of the Giantess Empire will be built using a one-woman-army model, condensing our most advanced technological achievements into a single being.\n\nGiven that all devastating repressive powers will be equipped on the same humanoid weapon platform, this project will be called the §YShipgirl Project§!."
  gts_ap_shipgirl.1.a: "Then let us, begin."
  gts_ap_shipgirl.2.desc: "After spending countless manpower, material resources, financial resources, and \"human\" power, Space Shipgirls are the ultimate form of the Giantess Empire's art of war. Their light bodies are enough to block the stars, their soft fingers crush battleships at will, and even just closing their jade feet can grind the terrifying titans of ancient empires into scraps underfoot. Their terrifying combat power, literally a one-woman army, makes them virtually unstoppable on the battlefield, able to directly confront the enemy's most powerful firepower and annihilate them."
  gts_ap_shipgirl.2.a: "Well done, continue like this."
  gts_ap_shipgirl.3.desc: "Even more terrifying is that these enormous titan giantesses not only serve as unassailable mobile fortresses but can also dominate the entire battlefield with their vast bodies. Once put into mass production, these maiden-like war machines will become the absolute symbol of the Giantess Empire's domination of the universe."
  gts_ap_shipgirl.3.a: "The whole galaxy will bow before our feet."

  GTS_HYPER_DRIVE: "Flesh-Based Hyperspace Engine"
  GTS_HYPER_DRIVE_DESC: "As fantastical beings capable of defying the laws of physics, it's not difficult for Shipgirls to perform hyperspace jumps using their bodies.

  DESTROYER_SHIP_THRUSTER_GTS_3_DESC: "Shipgirls who believe in the cuteness of white stockings often fight with only white stockings on their feet, making their calves and feet look even cuter.

  DESTROYER_SHIP_THRUSTER_GTS_4: "Naval Shoes"
  DESTROYER_SHIP_THRUSTER_GTS_4_DESC: "After equipping foot-based naval equipment shaped like loafers, the Shipgirls move faster, but the effect of charming enemies with their feet is greatly reduced by covering their soles. But it seems some people like this as well?"

  BEAUTY_GTS: "Hull Beautification"
  BEAUTY_GTS_DESC: "Modifying the Shipgirl's outer contours to suit the generally accepted aesthetics of the galaxy can effectively boost our troops' morale and disrupt the enemy's combat will. However, to maintain performance in this form, the Shipgirl's body must be built even larger."
  BOMBING_GTS: "Ultra-High Altitude Bombing Strategy"
