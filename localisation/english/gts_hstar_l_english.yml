She is currently only wearing high heels, and is completely naked everywhere else, including her private parts...\nI must say this monster has developed really T*D well. If it wasn't this size, I would definitely f*ck her sideways.\nWe tried to attack her with every possible weapon, including nuclear weapons, but even the intercontinental missiles at their highest point barely reached her ankles. Hitting her is like blowing a puff of air, it didn't cause any change!\nBut this creature can destroy several of our cities and several army groups with one kick, we simply can't deal with her!"

  gts_hstar.7.desc: "After talking with the president of Earth, we reached an agreement - to provide military support in exchange for sufficient resources needed for combat. However, while they call it support, it is really just sending a simple field fleet into action.\nFleet Commander K will lead a mobile force to attack the sensitive areas exposed by this giantess. As long as we can land on the target's clitoris and launch an attack against it, this giantess will be nothing more than the next plaything."

  gts_hstar.7.a: "Let them taste the 'pleasure' brought by the Humiliator."
  gts_hstar.8.name: "Foreplay"
  gts_hstar.8.desc: "An astonishing number of landing ships are quickly approaching her body. Soon, this force was divided into two parts: one group flew into the gaps between the toes of the giantess's left foot, and the other group accelerated towards her exposed perineum.\nThe troops heading to the vulva quickly arrived at their destination. At this time, the troops split again, heading towards her vulva and anus respectively. Fleet Commander K was sitting on one of the spaceships in the vulva group, looked at the huge female genitalia in front of him, and gave the order to fire. In an instant, various laser weapons sprayed out, turning into showers of light and flying into the unfathomable abyss.\n'Sir, she has begun to notice us.'"

  gts_hstar.8.a: "Okay, increase the firepower. And notify other troops to hurry up and inject the 'Humiliator'."
  gts_hstar.9.name: "The Humiliator"
  gts_hstar.9.desc: "A small force is pouring tanks of emerald-green liquid into a huge laser injection machine, and these liquids are slowly piercing into the body of this giantess along the huge machine.\nWith the increase of firepower from the vulva combat force, the giantess's vulva seems to be feeling more and more clear sensations. Sensor data shows that this behemoth is feeling a slowly rising sense of comfort. Under the stimulation of many forces, her clitoris, comparable to a city, is slowly protruding out of the deep valley, becoming more and more erect in front of the team.\nAt the same time, the team located at the anus also reported that their mission was proceeding steadily. After about a minute, the target began to produce some special behaviors, including licking her index finger and shaking her buttocks. The team at the anus assessed that this impact would be enough to shatter small and medium-sized satellites, but it did not have any impact on them."

  gts_hstar.9.a: "Land on the target's clitoris and execute the next step."
  gts_hstar.10.name: "Agitation"
  gts_hstar.10.desc: "The spacecraft landed on the target's clitoris, which was the size of a small island. Fleet Commander K slowly walked out of the spacecraft and stepped onto this pink land. The temperature here is very high, and you can even hear the sound of blood flowing at high speed under the 'ground', and feel the subtle but strong rhythm under your feet. If it were a normal human, standing here would result in heatstroke and burns within minutes, but our troops were not affected at all.\nThe troops landed quickly and orderly, and were soon ready on the clitoris.\nFleet Commander K took out a syringe from his pocket. Inside the syringe was a nanomechanical worm-like creature. It was a nano-invasive ripper. As an important auxiliary component of the Humiliator, its terrifying name indicates it can quickly penetrate the hard epidermis and enter the target's blood vessels, and finally enters the biological target's brain, and one of the purposes is to be able to transmit the user's voice to the biological target's mind. As the invasive ripper was injected into a towering blood vessel on the increasingly hot clitoris surface, the ripper quickly followed the high-speed flowing blood in the clitoris and went deep, traveling in the target's bloodstream."

  gts_hstar.10.a: "Let's see how many chances she has left."
  gts_hstar.11.name: "Attack"
  gts_hstar.11.desc: "'Sir, 'Humiliator' injection is 60% complete. At her current blood flow rate, it will affect her whole body in 10 minutes.'\n'Very good, then........' After listening to the report from the soldier behind him, K smiled slightly, as if everything was within the plan. Then he raised his right hand, and everyone raised a person-long, harpoon-shaped needle in their hands. 'Stab!' With an order, 450,000 silver needles pierced the fleshy ground under their feet.\n'Hmm!!!!!' The observation post reported that the target hurriedly covered her mouth, blocking the slightly leaked scream. The sensor prompts that the target is now in fear, presumably the sharp pain suddenly coming from the lower body. After all, this is probably the first time she has felt this real pain in a long time. Even more terrifying is that with this sharp pain, there is also a huge pleasure that comes. \nThe Humiliator can make the subject experience 'pain and pleasure'. After all, the pleasure that is painful but difficult to get rid of is the best nemesis for these dissolute creatures.\nThe target seems unable to understand the strange thoughts that are generated in her mind, but those thoughts are completely stimulated by this sudden burst of stabbing pain."

  gts_hstar.12.desc: "The local natives seem to be stunned by the scene in front of them: the invincible giant on the screen actually showed a painful expression!\n'Stab again!' In the clitoris area, a rain of silver needles pierced again.\n'Ah-!!!!' The target could no longer hold back, and an obscene scream came from her mouth! The originally upright body slumped down, slightly trembling.\nAlthough the ground under their feet was shaking violently, relying on the combat suits and our tens of thousands of years of experience and purification, the troops, like ticks, were firmly attached to the target's clitoris island, and continued to stimulate it to accelerate the target's blood flow to speed up the spread of the Humiliator.\nThe sensors indicate that the other party seems to be irritated, humiliated, and wanting to crush us with her hands. However, the force of our attack is even further, and pierced down again.\n'Ahhhhh!!!!'\nAs if an invisible big hand pinched the target's right hand that was about to fall, and punched her lower body heavily, causing her to retract her plump buttocks that had been sticking out. As usual, the target struggled to resist our attacks, and even more terrifying, the strange thoughts within her would corrode her brain--\nOur linguists quickly analyzed the language that the other party spoke. 'Wh...What's going on...It hurts, it hurts so much........but......why do I want it.......I really want to be...played with like a dog....'"

  gts_hstar.14.a: "Don't worry, lower your body, beautiful lady, let everyone get a good look at yours~"
  gts_hstar.15.desc: "You bastard...\n§YThe target obediently squatted down slowly, spreading her legs, completely exposing her fascinating secret garden to billions of people in the city below her feet.\nThe natives who were in fear under her feet watched in horror as the sky gradually darkened. Two enormous, meat-white giant pillars supported an equally huge and round pair of jade buttocks slowly descending. If someone looked through a high-magnification telescope, they could not only have a full view of this ultra-giant female's private parts, but they could also see in the distance that giant beautiful face filled with frustration and humiliation.\nMany little people are watching me. These bacteria that are smaller than dust are looking at my below........\n§Y A drop of love fluid slowly flowed out of her vagina, quietly slipping down a pubic hair to the tip. After a short pause, it fell under the force of gravity onto one of the cities below! Just a drop of secreted love fluid, like an atomic bomb, slammed down on the top of this poor city. For a time, it was like an overwhelming wave. Before people could react, they were washed away without a trace by a drop of her secreted love fluid.§!"

  gts_hstar.15.a: "Alright, now, kneel!"
  gts_hstar.16.desc: "§Y A huge, dizzying earthquake wave came, and the surrounding cities were instantly swallowed up by the huge cracks that appeared in the fractured ground. The natives near the epicenter had no idea what had happened, and were crushed into mud, while those in the distance watched in astonishment as the giant pillar in the sky actually thumped down onto both knees and knelt!§!\nWhen she knelt, the weight of her knees directly smashed a small side of the continent into the seabed, and the other one stirred up huge waves, hundreds of meters high, directly submerging these inconspicuous coastal areas.\nDie, die, die! "

  gts_hstar.16.a: "Initiate emergency jump!"
  gts_hstar.17.name: "Emergency Situation"
  gts_hstar.17.desc: "Our overly smooth progress made us arrogant, and this made us pay a corresponding price:\nA giant hand, like a small continent, suddenly pounced over, and with a degree of flexibility that was completely disproportionate to its size, grabbed a piece of the continent, and then fiercely rubbed the entire clitoris, like a little girl who had her bra strap snapped by the boys behind her.\n§R Die, die, you damn insect bastards! §!\nAfter a period of abuse, the piece of continent became nothing more than a small lump. For the target, it was just the size of a mud pill, like dust on the clitoris. It was picked up by the target, and then almost thrown to the ground, where she raised her right foot, and stepped on it again and again! §R The damn insects actually made me look so embarrassed... §!"

  gts_hstar.17.a: "Re-establish control!"
  gts_hstar.18.desc: "Hmph, so is this it? §YThe target returned to the posture she had when she first arrived on this planet, raised her toes, and wanted to step down again.§!\nIt seems you insects do have some tricks. You are so small, but you still made me take it a little seriously ~ Well~ but in fact, this kind of gameplay is quite novel. That certain guy though, that arrogant feeling is really annoying, a small being that is so small it can be ignored, actually dared to order me around, hmph, how ridiculous."

  gts_hstar.18.a: "Oh my, I didn't expect the Miss to have such an out of control moment."
  gts_hstar.19.desc: "You're not dead yet?\n§YThe target's foot that was about to step out suddenly stopped!§!\nImpossible! How could you not die! There can't be any insects that can survive under these conditions!"

  gts_hstar.19.a: "I knew it, a lady of the giantess kind wouldn't put down her pride and obediently listen to us."
  gts_hstar.20.desc: "You...you're still alive? Where exactly are you?\n§Y The other party's tone was full of doubt and shock. Her eyes were constantly scanning her body and the mud ball that had just bounced off under her feet.§!"
  gts_hstar.20.a: "Don't look for us, we're right in front of you~"
  gts_hstar.21.desc: "In front of you?\n§Y Before the behemoth in front of them could react, mobile landing craft located on her face, along with soldiers who had just jumped, charged towards her nostrils together.§!\nWhat do you think you are doing!\n§Y Although she tried to cover her nose and mouth, there were still oversized gaps between the huge dragons, which could not intercept the onrushing mobile landing force at all!§!"

  gts_hstar.21.a: "Everyone! Attack the nearest target!"
  gts_hstar.22.name: "Foreplay"
  gts_hstar.22.desc: "The landing forces lurking deep in the left toe seam and in a fold of the anus quickly received the commander's attack order. Those eager H-Star soldiers could not help but vent their long-accumulated bestial desires on the sexy toes and tender chrysanthemum in front of them. Barbed tongues and all kinds of torture tools began to ravage the huge body.\n§Y Ah, it's so itchy, so itchy! But it's also so comfortable........§!\nThanks to the effect of the Humiliator, the sensitivity of this huge body is dozens of magnitudes higher than normal people's. With the effect of the matching drugs, the effect of millions of spears in several concentrated attacks is no different from playing with her clitoris.\n§Y What's going on......my body is getting so weird......Ah! There......no, don't touch...§!\nThis giantess sat down on the ground, trying to use the mountains she didn't even pay attention a few minutes ago to scratch the itch, but those huge buttocks looked more like a crushing. The back door that was attacked by the H-Star soldiers was already red and open like a blooming flower, struggling with the attack of the H-Star soldiers penetrating the inside of her toenails. It was hard to bear the most delicate tissues, her mind was being scratched and her body was surging, to the point that drool was dripping from the corner of her mouth..."

  gts_hstar.22.a: "Look! That bitch seems to be very afraid of us coming here, so slutty!"
  gts_hstar.23.name: "The Fleet Commander's Additional Test"
  gts_hstar.23.desc: "Everything is under control, we have successfully controlled her mind and body... At least this time, the vital sign data shows that the other party has lost any will to resist. However, just to be on the safe side, the Fleet commander still ordered the other party to carry out some §Yadaptability§! actions... or rather, a loyalty test is more appropriate. For example, \n§YSImply step on a certain island 150 times!§!\nThe results of the test were very satisfactory to us. The target successfully carried out our orders. Even though the size of the island was not even the size of her toe, the target relied on the sliding of her toe on the ground to crush everything on the ground as slowly but thoroughly as possible, even if some sometimes went out of range, the assault members on her toes could use their tools to stimulate her to make her aware of it.\nThe monitor's report also pointed out that after this period of the Humiliator's effect and the stimulation of the assault team, the other party seems to have developed a kind of... peculiar masochistic psychology. She wants us to punish her from her heart in exchange for sexual pleasure.\nThe fleet commander once ordered her to lick the bottom of the high heels she had thrown on the ground before. After she cleaned it according to the order, with our permission, she directly inserted the heel into her lower body and was assessed to be in a state of lust. \nEven when we were about to evacuate, the other party tried to grab our ships to keep us, and although she stopped after being scolded, she had obviously fallen into an orgasm again and masturbated with the continent of the planet."

  gts_hstar.23.a: "Looks like we've got a good big toy."
  gts_hstar.24.name: "A Conversation"
  gts_hstar.24.desc: "§PThere is no need to use tough warfare against such a backward race, General? Only conquering the giantess who is more that a hundred times our size is a thing that can arouse our interest, that kind of child's play fight with no difference in body size and technological backwardness is meaningless and a waste of time...§!\n §BThat's why we intervened in this matter with a relatively equal status under the pretense of so-called trade. After all, this is their territory, and we have to be polite.§!\n§PHaha, you are quite the gentleman, Sir.§!\nThe two smiled at each other.\n§BActually, those countries or cities that were flattened by Haiyun, the leader of this planet told me to do it.§!\n§POh~ why is that?§!\n§YIt threatened his rule. He hopes to dominate the world and become the strongest force on this planet. It's normal for this to happen in a primitive civilization that has no racial unity.

This seems to be the main body of the subspace echo we detected earlier that was constantly approaching our galaxy.\n\nWe speculate that what we have encountered now is just the vanguard, and their main force has not yet arrived. So far, the reports that have followed are very confusing. The ships used by the invaders seem to be made up of materials we do not yet know of, and the invaders have not yet responded to any of our actions.\n\nOur entire galaxy may face an unprecedented invasion."

We, the survivors, are the goddess's loyal slaves.\n\nThe Goddess will soon be arriving here. We must act as quickly as possible to turn this place into her prized possession before they arrive.§!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.30.i: "Then what do you mean by 'devotion'?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.30.i.response: "§RIt's the literal meaning. Our only task is to dedicate everything to the beautiful and powerful Goddess! If you don't believe God, you will be turned to dust, or suffer eternally in endless purgatory!§!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.30.j: "We will purge you from the galaxy."

  gts_hstar_crisis.30.j.response: "§RWe have heard that a lot of times before. Hahaha!\n\nThe Goddess and God-Emperor can easily destroy all life on this planet. In the face of this cruel reality, what is your mere threat?§!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.51.name: "A New Force"
  gts_hstar_crisis.51.2.name: "The Sentinels Rise"
  gts_hstar_crisis.51.desc: "An organization fighting against the invaders has recently emerged in the galaxy. This organization seems to be mainly composed of exiled and oppressed groups - refugees, veterans, and others who lost everything in the crisis.\n\nNevertheless, their assembled fleets have managed to win several battles against the Solin Scourge. There are unconfirmed reports that some of their fleets have strangely designed warships..."
  gts_hstar_crisis.51.a: "Where did these people come from?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.desc: "We are the Sentinels. Our order has sworn to stop the bloodthirsty Solin Scourge at any cost. While other empires crumble, we continue to fight. When they give up resistance and fall into darkness, we provide them the means to fight back.\n\nI am Commander Kargas, the leader of the order. Do not be deceived by appearances, The Sentinel Order recruits from all species of the galaxy - including yours. We simply hope that your government will persist in the resistance against the Solin Scourge invasion, and support us where possible."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.a: "How have you managed to successfully resist the Scourge?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.a.response: "Many of the Sentinels have a military background. We came from the survivors of various fleets that were defeated in battles against the Solin Scourge. As Sentinels, we have learned from past mistakes and have worked hard to ensure such situations do not happen again.\n\nLikewise, I believe I mentioned that we recruit people from all the races of the galaxy. This also includes those ancient races such as [sentinel_fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We have the support of several influential factions from §H [sentinel_fallen_empire.GetName] §! who don't want to see their system devoured by Scourge. They have donated ships and resources to our cause."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.b: "Where is your base of operations?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.b.response: "We are in the process of establishing a main base in the [sentinel_system.GetName] system. These hidden system coordinates were provided by [fallen_empire.GetName]., who also helped construct our main base on the Guardian α. I believe this is quite an achievement. In the meantime, we have also built our own shipyards."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.2.a.response: "Many Sentinels have a military background. We are all survivors of various fleets who have fought against those crazed believers. Though defeated in the past, we have learned from our past experiences and strive to not make the same mistakes again.\n\nAs mentioned before, Sentinels hail from every species in the galaxy. Our hope rests in a small group of survivors from a lost empire that no longer exists in this galaxy-they have provided us with secret technologies and preserved fleets."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.new.b.response: "We have established our headquarters near §H [sentinel_system.GetName] §!. It was previously an uncharacterized black hole. It was §H [sentinel_fallen_empire.GetName] §! who disclosed this location to us. They also helped construct the Sentinel Alpha, which is our first spatial facility and also the homeport of our fleets.\n\nThis is a landmark achievement, especially considering how much time pressure we are under."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.2.new.b.response: "We have established our headquarters near §H [sentinel_system.GetName] §!. It was previously an uncharacterized black hole. We recovered the location of this black hole through a database from a lost fallen empire. In this same database, we also discovered some tech schematics that we deployed within the construction of Sentinel Alpha, which is both our first space facility and the homeport of our fleets.\"\n\nThis was something of an achievement, particularly considering the constraints on our timeframe."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.c: "Farewell."
  gts_hstar_crisis.52.c.response: "Continue the fight, my friends. The fate of our entire galaxy is at stake.\n\nSentinel One, out."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.desc_01: "The future of our galaxy can only go down one of two paths: either these lunatics sacrifice all organic life in this galaxy to that so-called goddess, and then continue their destructive march, or we completely eliminate them."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.desc_02: "We must redouble our efforts in the fight against the invaders. The fate of the entire galaxy is at stake in this war."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.desc_03: "Now the infighting between nations has no meaning. It's a waste to fight each other instead of these lunatics with our ships."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.desc_04: "Do not lose hope. Our galaxy still has a chance to win."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.desc_05: "If you cannot fight these lunatics head-on, you can donate resources to us. This will strengthen our forces to fight the Scourge invaders."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.a: "How much do you know about the Scourge?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.a.response: "Well, we don't know much, but we are sure that they originated outside the galaxy. They may well have destroyed dozens or even hundreds of star systems before arriving in ours… or perhaps we are their first victims.\n\nAfter they have completed the slaughter of all non-believers on the entire planet, they turn the planet into a hell that can only be described with a crazy nightmare. All other life forms on these planets cannot get rid of the control, and there is only one way to cleanse them, which is to burn the entire ecosphere with intense orbital bombardment."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.b: "Of course, we are willing to donate."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.b.response: "We thank you for your generous donation. These resources will allow us to equip a fleet to fight these lunatics! If other countries had your generosity, the war would end quickly."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.c.response: "As you should know, modern ships need a lot of energy to maintain them. We need 1000 energy in order to form a new team to deal with the current catastrophe."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.e.response: "Unfortunately, we cannot accept your donation at this time. The number of our fleet already exceeds the quota, and the logistics department is already overloaded. But anyway, we thank you for your generosity."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.d: "Farewell."
  gts_hstar_crisis.55.d.response: "The war will continue. Guardian One, out."
  gts_hstar_crisis.71.desc: "The Interstellar Guardians greatly appreciate your valiant efforts in resisting the invaders. Since the fleet commanders of [Root.GetName] have won consecutive victories, we want to permanently transfer one of our fleets to you. We are currently understaffed and cannot maximize the power of the fleet, but this shouldn't be a problem for you.\n\nBut you must make a solemn promise that you will only use these ships to fight these lunatics!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.71.a: "Of course... we will only use them to fight them."
  gts_hstar_crisis.71.a.response: "Very well. We believe that your heroic captains will be immortalized in history along with these great ships. We'll send the fleet near [Root.Capital.GetName]."
  gts_hstar_crisis.71.b: "We do not need your ships."
  gts_hstar_crisis.71.b.response: "That doesn't matter either. We only hope that you can continue to fight. With every messenger destroyed, we are one step closer to victory."
  gts_hstar_crisis.76.desc: "After many trials and tribulations, our galaxy has finally achieved victory. The so-called followers of the goddess were finally defeated. There was a time when we feared that this day would never arrive. But now, only one last mission remains. \n\nAs the Grand Commander of the Sentinel Organization, I hereby announce the dissolution of this organization. Our sole purpose was to defeat the invaders who invaded this galaxy. Now that this goal has been accomplished, it is time for us to part ways. In order to prevent the misuse of our current warships, they will be dismantled.\n\nMay the end of this galactic disaster mark the beginning of a new era of peace. This is Sentinel One, communication ended."
  gts_hstar_crisis.76.c: "Terminate communication."

  gts_hstar_crisis.81.desc: "Reports indicate that intense fighting is taking place near §H[sentinel_system.GetName]§!. The Sentinels' home system is on the verge of collapse.\n\nWe have received a long-distance communication fragment from §H Sentinel Alpha §! - the military space station used by the Sentinels as their headquarters. The star system is suffering from massive interference caused by weapon emissions and energy residue."
  gts_hstar_crisis.82.desc: "This... this is Sentinel Alpha. We have encountered  §R###signal corruption###§! ...fatal damage. The hull has been dented, and  §R###signal corruption###§! ...the commander has been confirmed killed. The number of enemies is just too many!\n\nWe... we are finished. Do not give up. For our future, you must never surrender. Don't let our efforts be wasted! We...we...Aaahhhhhhhhhhh-----  §R<Signal Lost>§!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.78.desc: "This is Sentinel One. The galaxy is in a critical moment, but I still have some good news to tell you.\n\nThrough experience gained in the long battles and through arduous research, our agents have finally compiled a very detailed anatomical directory of these damn things. For example, did you know that this race will orgasm to the point of losing their combat ability if they are stabbed through both sides of their chest and below their torso?\n\nWe will make these documents public. You can aim at these weaknesses we discovered, and your ships will be able to fight more efficiently."

  gts_hstar_crisis.101.desc: "One of our deep-space reconnaissance probes strayed into a battlefield relic in [gts_crisis_queen_system.GetName]. This battle was between a powerful fleet of these crazed believers and an unknown force. A center seems to have been severely damaged and abandoned here after the battle.\n\nThe probe used for reconnaissance reported that the center seems to be still active. Now is a rare opportunity to capture it and study it through reverse engineering."
  gts_hstar_crisis.101.a: "Send a research team over."

  gts_hstar_crisis.105.desc: "[Root.GetName] has repaired the damaged equipment of the signal center, albeit some of it with saliva and spit. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has filtered the signal that the center uses to contact its followers, and implanted a small positron device to communicate with each other in reverse. Now this signal center is under our control!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.105.a: "This will certainly be a useful asset!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.107.name: "Nexus Stolen"
  gts_hstar_crisis.107.desc: "The damaged signal center we discovered in the [gts_crisis_queen_system_1.GetName] system has unfortunately been stolen!

  gts_hstar_crisis.121.name: "Feral Believers Discovered!"
  gts_hstar_crisis.121.desc: "After the core was defeated, we failed to track some of the follower fleets that escaped in the chaos. Without the guidance of the core, most of these beasts without a faith to their hearts would wither and dissipate.\n\nHowever, recent sighting reports have confirmed that a large group of pirate-like followers are establishing a new core hub in the §H[feral_prethoryn_system.GetName]§! system.\n\nIn the future, it is likely that we will encounter pirate space stations built by them in the unoccupied star systems where the so-called Goddess believers once appeared. But it is unlikely that they will develop into a major threat - these guys are now fighting among themselves over who they should believe, and have not shown any signs of developing cohesion and pushing the disaster forward."
  gts_hstar_crisis.121.a: "Issue a travel advisory."
  gts_hstar_crisis.211.name: "Crisis Resolved"
  gts_hstar_crisis.211.desc: "With the last of the followers destroyed, the entire universe breathed a sigh of relief. Their invasion has completely failed, and the so-called 'Goddess' followers who once terrified countless creatures have now only left behind countless charred corpses and debris slowly drifting in the void.\n\nThe air of ease and joy spread at warp speed throughout the universe, and countless planets began to spontaneously hold events to celebrate this great victory. Perhaps, we can use this opportunity to turn over a new page of peace and stability in the universe?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.211.a: "These disrespectful creatures, the sooner they die, the better, they can even be used as fuel."
  gts_hstar_crisis.211.b: "They were worthy opponents."
  gts_hstar_crisis.211.c: "Their technology is quite interesting."
  gts_hstar_crisis.211.d: "Finally put an end to this pointless belligerence."

  gts_hstar_crisis.234.name: "The Final Signal"
  gts_hstar_crisis.234.desc: "In recent months, we have found the core's signal suddenly emitting a strong signal from its silence, and then falling into complete silence. At first, we simply thought it was because it was summoning a new fleet, but then our psychics told us that it was simply sending a strong signal. However, judging from the call sign... it should be the 'Goddess' they spoke of. \n\nWhen a scientific team of ours was studying the way the Prethoryn travel through interstellar space, they found a deviation in our astronomical database, which made us understand its meaning. When they were mapping out the route of these crazed believers, they found a small spiral galaxy roughly 30 million light-years away... and the bright spots inside are disappearing one by one.\n\nOur race discovered and studied this galaxy in the early space age, but now our observation devices show that no light is being emitted from there. This bizarre and unexpected discovery shocked our scientists, and they began frantically searching for the reason for the gradual disappearance of an entire galaxy.\n\nThere are currently two explanations: firstly, all the stars in the galaxy are being extinguished one by one; and secondly, something vast enough to cover the entire galaxy is blocking the light from reaching us step by step. But both theories are not tenable, they are simply fantasies. It's better to think that this galaxy never existed, and the previous records were errors made by the primitive telescopes. In any case, the whole incident is shrouded in a strong sense of horror and ominousness..."

At the time, we didn't study it too deeply. Now, we know why: Two giant humanoid beings are approaching with a speed that far exceeds the range that any of our existing materials and psionic technologies can withstand.\nBased on the current data calculated, the target of the other party should be our [hstar_goddess_land.GetName].

At a height of 280,000 km, [hstar_goddess_land.GetName] was like a mere yoga ball being stepped on by the two of them. Although there was a blue glowing shield, when facing the enormous soles of the feet, the sharp heels pierced through the shield like they were nothing, and stabbed into the shield emitters. As the planetary energy shield gradually dissipated, the huge soles followed and landed, turning the dense industrial areas and barracks on the planet into the appearance of moss and lichen, and turned them into ashes as they were crushed by the huge explosions and crushing. \n§E So dirty.§!\nWith another foot stomp, the young girl made a disgusted expression.

  gts_hstar_crisis.303.c: "What are you here for?"
  gts_hstar_crisis.303.c.response: "§Y What are we here for? Hehehehehe-§!\nThe other party's deafening sudden laughter almost broke the sound transmission equipment. She stomped her right foot, which was 45,000 km long. The already ravaged surface of the planet could not bear it at this moment. Even the fortified crust had been pierced in several places, and large amounts of mantle gushed out like boiling water, corroding the surrounding surface. §Y Of course we are here to f*ck you guys~!

With your current state, you will all be wiped out in a few moments!§!\n These pairs of colossal sisters moved their slender white legs, stepping on the ground with their high heeled thick soled shoes as if they were stepping on bubble wrap. Each footfall was more violent than the last. Earth-shattering vibrations ravaged the planet and the lives of the little people beneath the feet of these young girls. Even if they were not stepped on by those soles from the sky, the terrifying shockwaves created by the soles hitting the ground could send skyscrapers weighing ten thousand tons flying dozens of meters into the sky, but could not even come close to reaching the shoe sole's thickness."

There are more of them than mosquitoes... How annoying! They can't be chased away at all!§!\nCompletely unlike the firepower from other small races, these super giant girls were somewhat overwhelmed. It was like being bitten by a swarm of mosquitoes. The green-haired girl started to back down.\n§YHmph..... We're leaving!§!\nThe yellow-haired giantess frowned slightly."

Ah...§!\nThe green-haired girl wanted to check on the yellow-haired girl, but she hadn't even taken a few steps when her body was overtaken by a strange electrical sensation, just like the yellow-haired girl. With a huge boom, the green-haired girl's massive body also collapsed like the collapse of a mountain onto the ground.\nIn the back of the yellow-haired girl's neck, a tiny black speck, small enough to be completely invisible, crawled out of a pore. The planetary governor threw away the syringe in his hand, \"Forcing me to do it myself, oh boy, I'm going to torture you two to hell and back... Damn it, all the achievements I've made these past years were ruined by the two of you. I'm not a H-Star if i don't break you two, make you wish you were dead!\"\n§YYou insects.....release my younger sister...§! \nThe yellow-haired giantess struggled to get up, but did not have any strength. She could only let these tiny black dots, that had astonishing arm strength go through the fiber seams in her clothes and crawl freely on her skin. The pain started at a faint itch, and from there it went to an unbearable itch. Everything was so painful and long."

The surprised voice seemed to be coming from right next to her ear, but she couldn't see anything even with her eyes moving around.\n'Me? Just a small insignificant worm.' The planetary governor, who was standing next to the yellow-haired girl's eardrum and stroking this eardrum that was so large and unending, said, 'I didn't think it was so clean inside. It seems you clean this part up too, as well~'\n§YYou...where exactly are you, you come out here!§!\nBut, at this moment, the planetary governor was leaning against the yellow-haired giantess' eardrum, and looking at another bottle of wine-red 'Tormentor' injector he held in his hand. Looking at the tiny creatures with claws and fangs writhing inside the injector, the corner of his mouth twisted into a horrible leer.\n'Too bad..... It's time to ruin it~~ §R❤§!'\nSlowly, a syringe full of the 'Tormentor' was injected into the yellow-haired girl's eardrum blood vessels. As the needle pierced through, the violent 'Tormentor' was dancing with its fangs and attached itself to the blood, just like how the other Tormentor had spread, they are flowing to all parts of the giant girl's body. More over, because of the close vicinity, this syringe will travel faster to the giant girl's brain... \nAbout an hour later, the entire star sector could hear the heartbreaking screams from the two super giantesses. They were strange, ear-piercing, and they echoed throughout the universe."

Not only that, but above them is an even higher 'Goddess'.\nThe results of the interrogation showed that these two giantesses were not simply acting out of a whim, but wanted to 'recruit' us to fight against that higher-level goddess, and drag her from the throne. In return, we can mine the resources on their bodies.\nBut all of this has now vanished into thin air: The defeated giantesses can only lower their once high heads, and allow us to develop and ravage their bodies. Although the goals they proposed were extremely attractive, it is best to discuss and study it within the War Department before making a decision."
