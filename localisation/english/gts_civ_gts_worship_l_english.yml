  civic_gts_worship: "Giantess Worship"
  civic_gts_worship_desc: "The planet inhabited by this civilization has been frequently visited by giantesses since records began. Initially, their civilization viewed giantesses as terrifying natural disasters. However, as their technology advanced, they gradually came to understand the existence of giantesses and mastered how to utilize the bodily fluids, underwear, and other remnants left behind by giantesses to develop their own civilization. Today, they regard giantesses as a significant boon to their civilization's development and are ready to embark on a journey to the distant cosmos in search of more giantesses."

  gts_civ_gts_worship.2001.name: "Welcome Ceremony"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2001.desc: "News of our establishing contact with [from.GetName] has spread like wildfire. When the envoy sent by the other party arrived at [Root.GetName], the entire continent's population gathered at the landing site to witness their first \"divine miracle.\" Our security forces were completely powerless to stop such a massive crowd and were quickly overwhelmed, with the populace breaking through to worship at her feet.\n\n§H\"Eh? Eh~~~?\"§! This envoy had clearly never seen such a grand welcome. Even her massive body couldn't take a single step out of the encirclement formed by our citizens. \"Th-that...\"\n\nSeeing the giant envoy shyly and pitifully pouting in bewilderment, the crowd erupted in cheers, and some even began to climb her shoes, disregarding the danger!\n\n§H\"Really, what's up with this civilization~?!\"§! Despite her annoyed words, after the initial surprise, a faint blush and a slight smile appeared on her face. After discussing all matters with our representatives, she lowered her head to look at the tiny people in her enormous shadow.\n\n§H\"Since you like me so much, I'll give you these shoes as a gift~\"§! The envoy then removed her shoes, revealing her white-socked jade feet, eliciting another round of gasps from the crowd.\n\n§H\"You better take good care of my shoes. If I find any stains or damage on them next time, humph~\"§!\n\nThe giant white-socked toes wiggled slightly in the air, whether it was a serious threat or a playful goodbye. The giant envoy then vanished from the planet, leaving only her mountain-like shoes behind."
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2001.a: "National Celebration!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2001.b: "Develop the Shoes!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2002.name: "Gentle Giantess Envoy"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2002.desc: "Two years have passed, and the giant mountain of shoes standing on [Root.GetName] has become our most popular tourist attraction. Countless citizens come here to experience the power of giantesses and imagine future deeper exchanges with giantess civilizations. And today, one of the visitors is the envoy who left the shoes. She is now shrunk to our size, observing our civilization.\n\n§H\"Hmm, this civilization is quite interesting~\"§! She has reached the summit, the entire continent in view. Whether man-made or natural wonders, none are as grand as her shoes. §H\"How do they manage to not be afraid of us and even worship us?\"§!\n\nThe citizens climbing the mountain suddenly noticed the sky darken. When they looked up, they saw that it was the envoy, restored to her original size, blocking out the sun!\n\n§H\"Hi, I'm back! You've taken good care of my shoes. Hmm... I should give you a little reward.\"§! After hesitating for a moment, she extended her bare foot to the edge of our capital, her toes spreading slightly as if inviting us in. §H\"I, I heard you like to use our bodily fluids and even our dirt, so I'll specifically allow you to collect some, hmph~\"§! She said, feigning reluctance, her giant toes wiggling unconsciously, the resulting wind pressure strong enough to threaten our collection team like a hurricane. But they braved the danger and continued to collect fluids and dirt from the envoy's giant bare foot.\n\n§H\"And I have more good news for you. I'll be stationed here from today onwards to help you develop.  I look forward to working with you, little ones~♡\"§!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2002.a: "Warm Welcome!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2003.name: "Uninvited Guest"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2003.desc: "Some time has passed since the last giantess attack from [from.GetName], and everything seems to be back on track. On this ordinary day, the residents of [Root.GetName] suddenly felt a strong earthquake. When the tremors subsided and people looked out the window, they realized what had happened...\n\n§H\"Wow, I heard they were small, but this is just too~ tiny~♡\"§! A giantess landed on [Root.GetName]. Her innocent tone and bright, youthful smile couldn't hide the contempt and mockery behind them.  Seeing the panic in the city below, the giantess could no longer conceal her true thoughts. §H\"Really, is there any need for diplomacy with these little bugs?\"§!\n\nThis giantess seemed to be an envoy of a civilization, yet her attire was very casual.  She wasn't even wearing any shoes or socks, and her toes wiggled restlessly, unconsciously causing continuous earthquakes in nearby cities.  She then read out the diplomatic terms and demands of her civilization.\n\n§H\"If you have any objections…\"§! She lifted her giant bare foot, moved it over several cities, and then stomped down hard. §H\"Bring them up now~\"§!\n\nShe casually dismissed the massacre she had just caused, a single footfall resulting in millions of casualties. While waiting for our response, she dragged her jade foot on the ground again, causing millions more deaths.  We had no choice but to accept all of the envoy's proposals in hopes that she would leave quickly.\n\n§H\"Humph, your planet is quite comfortable to step on, almost as good as the carpet in my house.\"§!  The envoy didn't seem to take this occasion as the first meeting between two civilizations seriously. §H\"Happy cooperation, little bugs.  You better work hard and make it even more comfortable for me next time~\"§!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2003.a: "So Cruel!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2003.b: "So Enchanting!"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2004.name: "Cruel Giantess Envoy"
  gts_civ_gts_worship.2004.desc: "Two years have passed, and the rift on our [Root.GetName] is now lush and vibrant.  It's hard to imagine that this was the site of a giantess's wanton rampage across the continent two years ago.  Everyone who passes by can't help but marvel at the vast difference between us and giantesses.  One of these passersby is the giantess envoy who created this landscape.  She is currently maintaining our size and observing our civilization.\n\n§H\"Hmm, their civilization recovers quickly, and they don't fear us but worship us instead. They do have a little bit of value for domestication.\"§!  The envoy then returned to her world-covering size.  Unlike her casual attire last time, she now wears a long white dress and white high heels, appearing like a goddess descending upon the mortal world under the sunlight. \n\n§H\"Hello, little bugs.  Remember me?\"§!  The goddess lifted the tip of her shoe and moved it above our planetary capital.  §H\"If you don't remember, I can remind you~\"§!\n\nSeeing the citizens below go from panic to acceptance to prostration before the divine miracle, the goddess chuckled and lowered her shoe back down.  The resulting wind pressure and shockwave destroyed the outskirts of the city and caused considerable casualties.\n\n§H\"There are many bad giantesses in the universe, but you're lucky to have met this en... cough, goddess.  As long as you serve me well~♡\"§! The goddess gently lifted her long dress, revealing a glimpse of the scenery beneath. The small people directly below could see that the goddess's forbidden zone was slightly moistened, and even a bit of fluid was falling like rain. §H\"It's not like I can't show mercy and protect you~\"§!"

Most citizens were shocked by her huge size, and a very small number of people felt an unprecedented sense of crisis, but everyone agreed that we should try larger-scale engineering to better dock with Giantesses."
