  gts_bronya_astral_rifts: "The Azure Pact"
  gts_bronya.1.name: "Vast and Boundless"
  gts_bronya.1.desc: "We have successfully entered the astral rift, and what is presented to us is not the chaotic and dark environment we imagined, but an open space full of light, dotted with ruins-like structures. From time to time, we also see strange creatures swimming within.\n\nWith the arrival of subsequent research teams, we have successfully established a base here and completed an analysis of this space. Hidden within its chaotic gravitational field are endless resources. Everything here seems to be composed of a special energy. If used properly, it would provide enormous assistance. However, the native creatures do not seem to welcome us invaders, and the energy emanating around us also speaks of the harsh nature of the environment. Some research team members have even experienced strange hallucinations... All of this reminds us that this place is not benevolent, and exploration must proceed with greater caution."
  gts_bronya.1.a: "Explore Boldly"
  gts_bronya.1.b: "Proceed Cautiously"
  gts_bronya.1.b1: "We can also use this opportunity to collect more resources"
  gts_bronya.2.name: "Expanding Outward"
  gts_bronya.2.desc: "As we continue our exploration, the appearance of this environment gradually becomes clearer. Despite some difficulties, we have also achieved fruitful results. Through unremitting efforts, we have discovered that the energy here has an unusually high peak in one place, and then flows to an unknown place. If we track it, we might be able to understand everything that has happened here, and perhaps even find some unexpected gains?"
  gts_bronya.2.a: "Strengthen the Lines"
  gts_bronya.2.b: "Pursue the Trace"
  gts_bronya.3.name: "Camp Expansion"
  gts_bronya.3.desc: "We have successfully expanded our base here and harvested some resources, but during construction, more and more people have experienced adverse reactions, often appearing as hallucinations or headaches. After testing, it has been basically determined that it is the high level of psionic energy impacting their minds. This undoubtedly slows down our progress.\n\nAfter integrating and analyzing the hallucinations, we roughly learned of the outline of the events: a girl here gained great power and became a giantess, leaving in a hurry to look for something. We can use this information to speed up our exploration, maybe we can even find her."
  gts_bronya.3.a: "Explore Nearby"
  gts_bronya.4.name: "Giant Shadow Emerges"
  gts_bronya.4.desc: "While probing, we discovered a giant shadow in the distance. As we get closer, her body gradually fills our entire field of vision, allowing us to better observe her condition. No living thing can avoid such a massive body and, is dissipated into the energy floating in space through her unconscious collisions. Even attacks cannot cause effective damage, and are simply brushed away after a moment.\n\nShe wanders around, her light gray hair dividing the vast space. Countless creatures are lost and trapped within. She occasionally stops to carefully observe her surroundings, seemingly not planning to leave for the time being. Despite the great risk, this might be our best opportunity to come into contact with her."
  gts_bronya.4.a: "Approach Directly"
  gts_bronya.4.b: "Investigate Cautiously"
  gts_bronya.5.name: "Unknown Signal"
  gts_bronya.5.desc: "Scientists have received several signals of unknown origin, and after deciphering them, they all point to a common target: find §BSeele§!. Although we do not understand the entity mentioned in these contents, by tracking the source of the signal, we should be able to find the origin, and thus advance our exploration."
  gts_bronya.5.a: "Track the Signal"
  gts_bronya.5.b: "Ignore It, Collect Resources First"
  gts_bronya.6.name: "No Gains"
  gts_bronya.6.desc: "The search of the surrounding area is basically over, and what we have gained is just a meager amount of resources, which is not worth mentioning compared to the investment of the expedition team. More and more team members have begun to doubt the necessity of continuing their exploration. Defeatism is spreading. As it stands, perhaps giving up is a better choice?"
  gts_bronya.6.a: "Continue Exploring"
  gts_bronya.6.b: "End It Here"
  gts_bronya.6.b1: "This will end the event!"
  gts_bronya.7.name: "Approaching!"
  gts_bronya.7.desc: "We have finally approached the giantess. The surrounding environment has become warm due to the emission of her body heat. The misty air formed by the evaporation of sweat surrounds us, and this seems to have relieved our discomfort with the environment, strengthening people's belief in continuing to approach. Along the way, the remains of creatures that had been unconsciously crushed can be seen from time to time. We can only hope that we are lucky enough not to become an insignificant decoration on her skin, or crushed by her unconscious impact.\n\nNow a new problem is in front of us. Guaranteeing survival is already an enormous challenge. How can we communicate with her across such a huge size difference? Before solving this problem, our contact is forced to a halt..."
  gts_bronya.7.a: "We already came this far"
  gts_bronya.8.name: "Preliminary Investigation"
  gts_bronya.8.desc: "By analyzing the effects she produces, we can roughly determine her specific size and then formulate detailed countermeasures, while also collecting resources to accelerate our exploration.\n\nAlthough very frustrating, we must still face this reality. We have to try to establish contact with a celestial-level giantess who has not yet noticed our existence, and whose attitude is unknown. In any case, we must make full preparations before taking action..."
  gts_bronya.8.a: "Keep Trying"
  gts_bronya.11.name: "Finished"
  gts_bronya.11.desc: "Despite our efforts, the successive collapse of the exploration team made this exploration unprofitable. After much consideration, §Y[Root.GetRulerName]§! chose to recall the team.\n\nAfter the last person left the astral rift with the harvested resources, the exploration of the rift was declared over. No one knows if our investment was worthwhile, no one knows what else is unknown within, but in any case, this story has come to a conclusion here."
  gts_bronya.11.a: "Let it be"
  gts_bronya.12.name: "Attempt"
  gts_bronya.12.desc: "Through unremitting efforts and trial and error, and after paying a heavy price, we have finally explored several methods with a high success rate. Send the ships directly like moths to a flame to attract her attention and make her notice us. Using the few individuals in the team with awakened psionic talents, we may be able to send a signal to communicate with her, but with relatively low success. Or perhaps we can attack her directly, but the results, well...\nIn any case, it's time to take action!"
  gts_bronya.12.a: "Dispatch the Ships"
  gts_bronya.12.a1: "This will lead to the leader's death!"
  gts_bronya.12.b: "Attempt to Establish Contact through Psionics"
  gts_bronya.12.c: "Launch a Direct Attack"
  gts_bronya.12.c1: "Are you sure?!"
  gts_bronya.13.name: "Harvest Resources"
  gts_bronya.13.desc: "Our collection was successful. Large amounts of resources were refined into the forms we needed. This harvest boosted morale and further solidified our motivation for exploration."
  gts_bronya.13.a: "Return to Exploration"
  gts_bronya.13.b: "Continue Collecting!"
  gts_bronya.14.name: "Engagement"
  gts_bronya.14.desc: "Although we have done our best, we still cannot cause her any effective damage, but it has successfully attracted her attention.\n\n\"Hey, are you not a quantum creature of this place, are you still attacking §CBronya§!\" After saying that, a massive hand descended towards the expedition team, engulfing everyone in shadows. While destroying the dilapidated buildings, it also crushed almost everyone. Only a few people survived in the palm lines, and they left this place in a panic.\n\n\"Did they run away, a new lead, I suppose?\" Looking at the few people leaving, §CBronya§! decided to follow them, also for the sake of some small retribution against that earlier attack."
  gts_bronya.14.a: "az"
  gts_bronya.15.name: "Return, But What Next?"
  gts_bronya.15.desc: "The expedition team has returned from the rift, but what accompanies them is not resources or friendship, but a hostile celestial-level giantess. We cannot predict her next actions, but we must prepare for the worst."
  gts_bronya.15.a: "Uh oh"
  gts_bronya.16.name: "A Flare?"
  gts_bronya.16.desc: "With a spirit undeterred by death, a ship slowly approaches the giantess. The sweat-fog blurs every porthole, an increasingly intense scent assaults the mind, and only the rising temperature inside the ship indicates that death is approaching step by step.\n\nWith a small flare, the ship crashes into §CBronya§!'s body. The slight sensation makes her feel strange, and after seeing the nearly imperceptible wreckage of the ship floating beside her, §CBronya§! finally discovers our expedition team. §CBronya§! slowly bends down, her silver-gray eyes reflecting the frightened expressions of people. §CBronya§! simply smiles slightly, waving her hand to the people as a friendly gesture."
  gts_bronya.16.a: "Fortunately, We Succeeded"
  gts_bronya.17.name: "Psionic Communication"
  gts_bronya.17.desc: "We have successfully used our leader's psionic talent to construct a channel to transmit information to her. Although the signal is weak, we have successfully established communication.\n\n\"§BSeele§!?\" §CBronya§! is startled upon receiving the communication. The anticipation and excitement in her eyes cannot be hidden, but after carefully confirming the source of the communication, she cannot help but reveal a look of disappointment. Following the psionic traces, §CBronya§! successfully discovered our expedition team. \"Who are you? What do you want from §CBronya§!?\""
  gts_bronya.17.a: "Communicate with Her"
  gts_bronya.17.b: "Attempt to Control Her"
  gts_bronya.17.b1: "Are you sure you want to do this?"
  gts_bronya.18.name: "§CBronya§! Joins"
  gts_bronya.18.desc: "After we explain our intentions clearly, §CBronya§! completely drops her guard and instead makes a request to us. \"Could you replace §CBronya§! in searching the Sea of Quanta? In return, §CBronya§! will join you and do her best to provide assistance. Is that acceptable?\"\n\n\"As for ships and leaders, §CBronya§! can help reconstruct ships, but §CBronya§! is powerless to help with her sacrifices.\" We should probably agree to her request, shouldn't we?"
  gts_bronya.18.a: "Accept"
  gts_bronya.19.name: "§CBronya§! Joins"
  gts_bronya.19.desc: "Through psionic communication, we are able to exchange information conveniently with §CBronya§!. After explaining our intentions, §CBronya§! proposed to accompany us.\n\n\"The reason? §CBronya§! has already searched this place in general. If §BSeele§! is still here, §CBronya§! would definitely feel it! Therefore, §CBronya§! believes that §BSeele§! has left this place and §CBronya§! wants to go to your universe to find §BSeele§!. §CBronya§! will also provide help during this period if needed."
  gts_bronya.19.a: "Okay!"
  gts_bronya.20.name: "Control Failed"
  gts_bronya.20.desc: "Probing strands of psionic energy into §CBronya§!'s mind, no matter how much power we poured into it, it was like a stone sinking into the sea without causing ripples. Instead we have attracted the attention of §CBronya§! . \n\n\"What are you doing?!\""
  gts_bronya.20.a: "Oops"
  gts_bronya.21.name: "Great Harvest!"
  gts_bronya.21.desc: "We have achieved a considerable and objective harvest. A large amount of resources were successfully extracted and many rare resources are displayed before us, adding to the foundation for the empire's construction. The surrounding resources have basically been extracted. Now it is time for us to return to exploration, but perhaps we could try one last collection attempt?"
  gts_bronya.21.a: "Yay!"
  gts_bronya.22.name: "Psionic Contact Fails"
  gts_bronya.22.desc: "Although we have done our best, a though broken, the signals made §CBronya§!feel strange, but definitive information has still not been successfully transmitted to §CBronya§!'s mind. We still need to make efforts to try to establish communication."
  gts_bronya.22.a: "Sad"
  gts_bronya.1001.name: "Bronya Joins"
  gts_bronya.1001.desc: "After a series of encounters in the rift, Bronya finally decided to join us, and we will replace her to continue exploring the rift, hoping to find traces of Seele there."
  gts_bronya.1001.a.name: "So why don't you explore it yourself?"
  gts_bronya.1001.a.desc: "Bronya has roughly explored the surroundings. If Seele was present, Bronya would have sensed it. As for a finer search, we need your help."
  gts_bronya.1001.b.name: "Relationship with Seele"
  gts_bronya.1001.b.desc: "Bronya has always treated Seele as a younger sister and is her closest family member."

  gts_bronya.1001.c.desc: "Bronya will continue to stay here. As for when she finds Seele, we'll talk about then"
  gts_bronya.1001.d.name: "What can you do?"
  gts_bronya.1001.d.desc: "Military, management ... Bronya can take on any position if needed."
  gts_bronya.1002.name: "Contact"
  gts_bronya.1002.desc: "§CBronya§! finally passed through the rift and arrived here. Our preparations seemed incredibly fragile and were destroyed in an instant, drifting in the empty depths of space. Subsequent attacks came one after another, but were easily blocked by §CBronya§!, without causing any effective damage. She floats quietly in the void, as if waiting for our next move."
  gts_bronya.1002.a: "Well, can we reconcile owo?"
  gts_bronya.1003.name: "Engagement"
  gts_bronya.1003.desc: "After a moment of thought, §CBronya§! spoke her condition: \"It's not impossible, but you must pay the price for such recklessness.\" Hearing this, §Y[Root.GetRulerName]§! almost without hesitation chooses to carry on with the struggle to the end, even if the hope is slim, they will try to fight a celestial-level giantess."
  gts_bronya.1004.name: "§CBronya§! Defeated"
  gts_bronya.1004.desc: "Did §CBronya§!'s mission fail...?"
  gts_bronya.1005.name: "Acquire Core"
  gts_bronya.1005.desc: "After yet another search of the Sea of Quanta, we have tracked the previous traces of Seele. Because it was too small, it was previously categorized as the result of undercurrents. Now we can track her traces and condense a crystal of power."
  gts_bronya.1005.a.name: "..."
  gts_bronya.1006.name: "Traces"
  gts_bronya.1006.desc: "After tireless searching, we finally found traces of Seele. After being swept away by the undercurrent in the Sea of Quanta, Seele's original body was destroyed in the process, merging with the vast energy and coming to this universe through the cracks of the Sea of Quanta.\n\nThe colorful energy blended with the light of the stars, flowing like a liquid and shimmering with strange brilliance. The original nebula material constantly changed its shape with the flow of this vast energy, connecting the material flow between several star systems, and showing this miracle beyond any natural scenery to countless beings. \"Is it really safe to make direct contact? It feels dangerous...\" Although saying that, §Y[Root.GetRulerName]§! still slowly probed into the surging energy, feeling the warmth coming from all around.  §Y[Root.GetRulerName]§! could not help but feel relaxed and at ease. The vision gradually blurred, and with closed eyes they completely lost perception of the outside world, falling asleep peacefully... \n\n\"What just happened?\" §Y[Root.GetRulerName]§! slowly regained consciousness in Bronya's hand, and for a moment they had not remembered what happened before.\n\n\"If you really want to be close to Seele that much, there's no need to hurry.\" Bronya placed §Y[Root.GetRulerName]§! aside, using the authority of the Herrscher of Reason, draws out the most familiar part from the energy in front of her and reconstructs a new body for Seele to be able to arrive here in a brand-new form."
  gts_bronya.1006.a.name: "Welcome Aboard"
