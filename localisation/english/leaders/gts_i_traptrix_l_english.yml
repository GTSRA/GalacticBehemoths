  situation_traptrix_ascription_desc: "The research results from the Terminus are a mixed bag. Luckily, they still see themselves as one of us, willing to offer help, but it seems to be based on a deal with us... Do we have to keep bearing their endless demands...? \n\nThis seems to have a profound impact on the multi-species coexistence of our empire... We must make decisions before these Traptrix become completely uncontrollable."

  gts_traptirx_anomaly_desc: "This star system has a habitable planet, and there also seems to be a lot of vegetation on it, but no traces of any civilization have been found above, and we can't even see any creatures of ordinary size called large animals on it."
  gts_traptrix.2.name: "No Man's Land?"
  gts_traptrix.2.desc: "Although many people have disappeared during the investigation, our investigation has finally yielded results. Although we have not seen other intelligent life in this area, we have still successfully established an outpost for further investigation."
  gts_traptrix.2.a: "Great"
  GTS_TRAPTRIX_SPECIAL_PROJECT: "Deep Exploration"
  GTS_TRAPTRIX_SPECIAL_PROJECT_DESC: "We have successfully established an observation station on the Traptrix Garden, which can be used as a supply point for our investigation of this planet. Next, let us continue to investigate this planet... but some special [consumables] may be needed in the investigation."
  gts_traptrix.3.name: "Deep Exploration"
  gts_traptrix.3.desc: "We found a huge portal in the underground of the planet. This portal seems to lead to a wider area. We also found some traces of artificial influence on the surface of the planet. Perhaps we can find the truth by going to the underground of the planet... that is, those Bottomless Pits."

  gts_traptrix.10.name: "Garden Entrance"
  gts_traptrix.10.desc: "We went deep into it for investigation. In addition to the transfer device, we also prepared high-strength special ropes to ensure that people can be brought back to the surface physically even if the equipment fails. Our initial investigation went very smoothly. No faults occurred when we went 500 meters deep. The previous batches of investigators brought back ordinary soil and rocks, which did not differ from other planets in terms of soil quality, but when exploring deeper areas, we only heard a sentence 'I saw... a pink rock here...' After that, we lost contact with the other party. When we hurriedly pulled it up, the safety rope had broken. The remaining liquid at the end seemed to be the culprit - it corroded the original corrosion-resistant safety rope, and the investigators who went deep into it also seemed to have failed to return successfully this time..."
  gts_traptrix.10.a: "Too bad..."
  gts_traptrix.11.name: "Deep into the Garden"
  gts_traptrix.11.desc: "After our last failure, we decided to use more protection measures to deal with the dangers below. We used the latest imperial probe ship to carry 4 people to explore the Bottomless Pit, and this time an abnormality occurred when we were about 700 meters deep...\n\n————Voice record sent back————\n\n'When did the surroundings become like this... Is this what he saw last time?'\n\n'...The voice sent back last time said it was pink, but what we see now... seems to be crimson walls, but the texture of these things seems to be different from that of rocks?'\n\n'And it looks like there is some liquid. Can we excavate part of the nearby things to return for investigation...'\n\n'Try it... No! Our robotic arm was directly corroded when it touched the liquid on it! Almost in an instant! And... and that's not a rock, it's soft!'\n\n'...Damn it, what the hell is this place? Return immediately!'\n\n'We... we are now closed above! All around... and above are red! There are also the same acidic liquids falling!'\n\n'It seems that we are in the belly of a big guy. Can we go down! There seems to be some liquid below. Our ship has been tested by giant girls in the galaxy and can survive in gastric juices for tens of hours, so immediately go down...'\n\n[Sound of falling into water]\n\n——————End of record——————\n\nAlthough this investigation failed, there was still some progress, but judging from the voice and related photos sent back, the probe ship seemed to have entered the stomach of a giant girl in the end, and the digestive ability of this giant girl's body far exceeded the upper limit that our probe ship could bear. It was corroded by gastric juice in just an instant.\n\nPerhaps we can't explore from the Bottomless Pit, but... this also gives us enough information to determine that the surface below the ground definitely has other creatures."
  gts_traptrix.11.a: "Continue digging"
  gts_traptrix.12.name: "Stepping into the Garden"
  gts_traptrix.12.desc: "Since entering from the entrance is not possible... then why don't we use our own entrance? We started excavation operations on the entrance and the edge. If we completely expose the underground situation to the sunlight... maybe we can find the truth of this planet.\n\nWhen we were about to complete the excavation, we suddenly received a communication from below the surface of the planet\n\n'It is a serious crime to destroy the Garden entrance! Especially to destroy the trap entrance! We order you to stop the project immediately!'\n\nAfter receiving this message, we immediately responded. When the other party received our diplomatic application, they seemed very surprised from the other party's response, but they also agreed to our invitation for a meeting. [And when we showed our technological level and size, especially after learning about the situation of our fleet... it seemed to have brought a lot of confusion to the leaders of the race that call themselves Traptrix]\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the meeting\n\n'Other residents on the surface of this planet? Then you came at a bad time. We just finished preying on those bugs a few hundred years ago, and then the next batch we raised hasn't had time to be thrown on the surface yet. We were wondering why we could still occasionally eat new things even though this batch has been hunted - I thought it was the last fish that slipped through the net'\n\n'…Bottomless Pit? Are you talking about the Garden entrance? That is our most important thing. As long as a Bottomless Pit is established, the creatures that fall into it will become our nourishment... Even big guys will be reduced by these Bottomless Pits and enter our \"holes\". You said where exactly...? Everyone has different hobbies. At least I prefer to put the bugs in the bottom for absorption'\n\n'Want to know our digestive ability... Wow, is it really okay to talk about this topic when we first meet?... Tsk, I know this is a serious topic. After entering our body, as long as we don't let it out voluntarily, we haven't seen anyone being able to get out~ Do you want to try it? You shouldn't die, right... As long as I can bear it, after all, you look quite delicious...'\n\nIn this exchange, we obtained the main information from the other race. The Traptrix are all women. They seem to have an unusual craze for predation and putting other creatures into their bodies through various Bottomless Pits for absorption. After communicating with us, they also agreed to live as an affiliated race of our empire... And their two leaders will also hand over power to us in the future and be assigned by us\n\n'…Wuwu, it's just that although we have a big gap and the meeting was not pleasant, at least don't treat us like slaves…'"
  gts_traptrix.12.a: "Great"

  gts_traptrix.200.name: "Traptrix's Bottomless Pit"
  gts_traptrix.200.desc: "Since the Traptrix race joined our empire, although we have used our production of little people to meet their daily needs, their lifestyle has caused us trouble... Especially their uncontrollable hunting habits, whether it is the little people or the giantesses, seem to be within their hunting range. If other races in the empire accidentally step into the traps they create, the best result is to be put into their 'holes' and become their short-term daily pastime, and the rest... well, the troubles they have caused are piled up in front of you, this mountain of cases is the result of what they caused... \n\nLooking at the various accidents and cases caused by the Traptrix after joining your empire, you should know that it is time to make a decision..."
  gts_traptrix.200.a: "Respect their nature."

  gts_traptrix.200.b: "It's time to let them understand what harmonious coexistence is."
  gts_traptrix.300.name: "Rapidly Increasing Disappearances"
  gts_traptrix.300.desc: "There have been a large number of missing cases on §Y[event_target:gts_traptrix_target_planet.GetName]§!. Both the small people and giantesses have been victims, and the disappearance time is usually not very long, two weeks at most and a few hours at least. The missing people generally return home after a period of time, and some are fainted on the street covered in mucus. Asking them yields no results, only knowing that they fell into a trap and into the body of a giantess. The specific location and corresponding character are unknown, and when asked about what happened to them, the results are very difficult to say.\n\nContinuing like this may affect production and activities, and now all indications show that these disappearances are behind the Traptrix who joined our empire... Now the matter cannot be suppressed any longer, at least to find out who did it."
  gts_traptrix.300.a: "Hand it over to §Y[event_target:gts_traptrix_target_leader.GetName]§! This matter must be dealt with."
  gts_traptrix.300.b: "This kind of thing? Let me see for myself."

  gts_traptrix.300.c: "Since the missing people will come back, there shouldn't be too much of a problem. I don't need to be bothered with this kind of trivial matter."
  gts_traptrix.310.name: "Rapidly Increasing Disappearances"
  gts_traptrix.310.desc: "§Y[event_target:gts_traptrix_target_leader.GetName]§! finally returned to her post after disappearing for two weeks, and she quickly dealt with all the cases related to the disappearance and brought all the involved Traptrix to justice - but none of the Traptrix who were arrested were put into prison, but were temporarily deprived of their citizenship by her to use as §Y[event_target:gts_traptrix_target_leader.GetName]§!'s private property. Given her identity, this mode of punishment is not surprising. Rumor has it that she also fell into the Traptrix's trap and was used as collective toys by the Traptrix for several days. However, these comments will be quickly found and spread, and then punished.\n\nAfter this incident, the number of missing cases throughout the planet has only increased, and even more rampant, but §Y[event_target:gts_traptrix_target_leader.GetName]§! can quickly respond, solve the case, and bring the involved Traptrix back to the room... With such a planetary governor, it is probably only a matter of time before the disappearance phenomenon in the area is completely resolved..."

  gts_traptrix.310.a: "Hopefully!"
  gts_traptrix.320.name: "Rapidly Increasing Disappearances"
  gts_traptrix.320.desc: "You decided to investigate this incident yourself, no matter what, this should not happen within the Empire! Then, within minutes of you secretly entering §Y[event_target:gts_traptrix_target_planet.GetName]§! in a private aircraft, you unexpectedly... stepped into the Traptrix's trap. After a brief moment of weightlessness, you felt your body was wrapped in flesh walls, and next to it was a pleasant floral fragrance. Then looking forward, you saw two smooth legs like jade and two legs in front of you that were almost twice as long as you are now - you immediately realized that you were reduced and teleported by the Traptrix's trap into their vagina!\n\n'Hmm~ It seems that the trap has caught a new little guy~ judging from this size, it seems to be a §S[root.GetSpeciesName]§!~?' Then, you turned your body and looked up at the other party's sight. You saw the other party's stunned expression, '...Eh... with this appearance, there shouldn't be anyone in the Empire who looks like him...'\n\nAfter a commotion and communication confirmation, the Traptrix in this area gathered around. The fact that the trap caught the Empire's leader made them feel some worries about the future in addition to excitement... Then they all decided unanimously - let's put the future aside! Now the most important thing is to revel! So, a silver party centered on you who has been shrunk... has begun. Given your identity, they still gave you some choices, but only gave you the choice of how to be used"
  gts_traptrix.320.a: "Just let it be like this…"
  gts_traptrix.320.b: "If possible... how about taking me out of here first...?"

  gts_traptrix.320.c: "Other holes, is that okay?"
  gts_traptrix.321.name: "Dancing with Traptrix"
  gts_traptrix.321.desc: "Your body is firmly fixed in the vagina by the vines of the Traptrix, only half of your body is exposed outside, and the cave below makes a sound of water. Then in a burst of giggles, you are inserted into another Traptrix's body like a dildo. With a groan that is inaudible, you are repeatedly thrusted as a toy. The surrounding female hormone气息 and love液 prevent you from opening your eyes. The friction with the flesh walls and the high temperature in the other party's body invade your whole body and brain. After a storm of sex for you, you find that the upper half of your body is also controlled by several other vines, and the vines on the lower body have been released at some point.\n\n'So... next round~❤' After a voice came from above, you immediately felt another moist feeling from under your feet - and a honey smell that does not belong to the third Traptrix who just used you for sex. You immediately understood your position in this silver party - a public dildo.\n\nThis party lasted for a day and a night, and you don't remember how many girls you were taken out from under and inserted into another girl's body... When they were all exhausted and snoring, you finally found a chance to escape this cave."
  gts_traptrix.321.a: "This experience will be used in the next time…"

  gts_traptrix.321.b: "These Traptrix must be severely punished!… Send them to my room first."
  gts_traptrix.322.name: "Dancing with Traptrix"
  gts_traptrix.322.desc: "'Since it is the leader's order, we will naturally obey it~' After hearing their words, you breathed a sigh of relief, and your body was gently pulled out of the vagina by their gentle movements. However, what followed was a tender foot that quickly magnified in your sight - \n\n'But wouldn't it be a waste if we didn't do anything~' After saying that, your body fell into the soft flesh of the feet on both sides, the air in the lungs was completely squeezed out, replaced by a pleasant floral fragrance and a slight foot odor - several lifts of the feet and rubbing also made the foot sweat气息 in this small space formed by the soles of the feet.\n\nYour body is rubbed in the soft flesh of the soles of the feet on both sides. Several times you try to escape from the soles of the feet, you will be gently pressed back to the arch of the foot by the toes, replaced by a new round of invasion of your body. After several squeezes, you have completely lost consciousness, and your body seems to be lying on the feet of the Traptrix like a soft foot worm, and your consciousness also falls into nothingness with the pleasant floral fragrance.\n\n\"After waking up, you find that the floral fragrance has not dissipated around, but the environment has turned into a pitch black, and your body is still unable to move - you realize that you seem to have fallen into the socks of the Traptrix, in intimate contact with the other party's soles, and the other party felt you wake up from your sleep, and gently stepped on it as a response - it seems that you will live a few days of sock people life."
  gts_traptrix.322.a: "This experience will be used in the next time…"

  gts_traptrix.322.b: "These Traptrix must be severely punished!… Send them to my room first."
  gts_traptrix.323.name: "Dancing with Traptrix"
  gts_traptrix.323.desc: "After your words were spoken, it seemed that the atmosphere of the Traptrix in the entire area became even more enthusiastic - they fiercely discussed your arrangement, and then, in their chattering noise, your body was picked up by a worm girl, and then another Traptrix cocked her ass and pulled open her backhole - it seems they reached a consensus\n\n'The digestive and absorption ability of the Traptrix is very strong, so as long as it is controlled well, there will be no strange things even in the back~ well, but putting it in the back will indeed have a psychological impact, please... please bear with it a little~❤' You heard the voice coming from behind, and before you could reply, your body was inserted into the chrysanthemum hole, and the first thing you felt was the terrible smell from the other party's chrysanthemum hole - and before you could struggle, the fingers behind you also began to slowly push your body into it. The sphincter and intestinal meat also cooperated, like a giant snake slowly pushing your body into the intestine - in a short time, your body was completely sent into the body of the Traptrix, and then the sticky intestinal fluid completely covered your body, and then the intestinal wall began to become active, sending your body deeper - and your vision, breathing, and touch were completely covered by everything under the other party's chrysanthemum hole... No matter what kind of struggle, it was digested in the sticky, strange 气息 intestinal meat around it. \n\n'Pa Pa' In your struggle, you heard the sound of patting your belly outside through two layers of flesh walls. 'Now, it should be here... If you get here, then rest well in your temporary single residence... After you go out, there are other sisters who are curious about what it feels like to be stuffed in. During this time, please help your people to relieve their curiosity~❤'"

  gts_traptrix.1999.a: "How is your race now?"

The duties and abilities she can perform far exceed her previous state. After discussions with them, we decided to arrange another investiture and onboarding process.\n\nThe giant emblem we originally gave to the giantess race was like a grain of sand in her hands. Sera casually hung it on her body like an earring.\n\n'Well, well, I will still respect the Empire's things. When does the ceremony start? Is it over already?'"
  gts_traptrix.2000.option: "Welcome back, Sera"

Or rather, the fact that I can now move directly in space is already beyond my expectations - at first I was a little scared when I saw the original research ship next to me like a small bug, but I got used to it later. If I had to say... now I feel… a little empty down there… it seems even more serious than before."

All indications show that the research on the Terminus black hole originated from the exploration of the ultra-ancient Juggernaut ruins. However, the research on this is very important whether it is the exploration of the essence of our galaxy or even the universe, or the impact on the future of our empire.

And when they soared freely between the planets, and the planets were like small glass beads beside them, we realized how huge their bodies are now... now their size has far exceeded the size of a star, and now they can easily use planets as toys. When they stayed in front of our capital planet, the display of their huge size brought a lot of pressure to our capital, fortunately, they still regard themselves as members of our empire, and carefully avoid our colonial planets and facilities when traveling between galaxies.\n\nHowever, when they stretched their fingers into our atmosphere, it still caused a lot of riots on our planet. With just a light touch, they casually erased a large section of the highest mountain range in our empire.\n\n'Huh, I didn't like seeing this when I was on the ground, now it's much more comfortable~' Outside the atmosphere, we heard Sera's voice. It seems that even after becoming a celestial-level giantess, she still maintained her original mental state. Next, she happily agreed to our second communication, on the one hand, of course, her experiences between the Terminus black holes, and secondly... both of them took it for granted that their new strength was enough to be the capital to negotiate with us again.\n\nFrom the communication with them, we learned that after they entered the Terminus black hole, they only glimpsed the scenery on the other side for a moment. The other side is a much larger world. Compared to that, our universe can be said to be insignificant, and she also saw a giant girl like a goddess over there. The exit of the Terminus was between her toes, and our planet... no, it should be said that the universe was as small as a mosquito in front of her. Just as they were planning to explore further, the universe on the other side suddenly began to repel the two Traptrix leaders. The huge pressure around them attacked the research ship, easily destroying the shipborne shields and the hull. Just when Sera and Allomerus were desperate, they suddenly found themselves back in the Terminus black hole, and... the black hole gravity and mass did not seem to have any effect on them. Because they were affected by the giant goddess on the other side of the world, If they only touched her jade feet for a moment, they had the ability to obtain energy from the black hole and the other end of the Terminus black hole, and the Terminus black hole obviously cannot support the reverse energy transportation from the other end for a long time, so naturally, in their actions Gradually depleted, eventually became history.\n\nAs for their situation\n\n'Uwa… If you don’t have enough energy to replenish after absorbing the energy over there for a long time, you will naturally be hungry. Our current state should be able to help you solve a lot of enemies. We feel that we can easily capture and eat the planets of those bad guys!

' Sera brought her face to the side of the planet and carefully observed the moss-like civilization above.\n\nFacing this huge green eye that was observing itself, [gts_tensi_destroyed_planet.GetName] also launched a counterattack. All the weapons on the planet and all the weapons that could attack the enemies in space attacked Sera - among them was a troop carrier.\n\nSera also noticed this, opened her mouth to all the weapons that hit her, and then, in one bite, took all the attacks into her mouth\n\n'Awoo - um... ugh... not delicious!'\n\nThen, everyone on the planet watched, as the massive green-haired girl swallowed all the attacks that could be called weapons on this planet, and the green-haired girl's evaluation of a massive attack powered by an entire world power was merely a simple and short, \"unappetizing\".\n\n'There's no point in having a trash planet like this. No wonder the leader wants me to deal with this planet. Useless things are best to enter the place where waste should go. Then, I wish you all good luck~'\n\nWith that said, Sera directly pinched the planet with her hand - directly turning almost a quarter of the planet's area into ruins and debris. The tsunami caused by her fingers slamming directly into surface also made the already significantly reduced population even worse. Sera didn't care about this at all. Instead, she directly took off her skirt, and then - bend down, placing the planet before her anus. The tiny remains of survivors that were on the side that would soon get devoured looked up to the sky, and found that the sky had already be completely obscured by the backside of a giant pink-haired girl. And at the very center was a gaping anus; like a sign of \"welcome\" to new potential \"friends\"\n\n'Wooo hooo hooo~ This is where you will be going next~ It should be what bugs do to associate with waste gas and feces~ so~ goodbye~'\n\n\"With a sense of weightlessness, the surviving population could only watch as the anus in the sky gradually approached. Then - the entire planet entered the intestines of the loli Traptrix, and the surrounding odor, and dark red flesh walls, are constant reminders that the entire planet has now become the girls internal parasites.\n\n'Well, at least you don't have to worry about my feces completely destroying you - after all, it won't be fun if it's destroyed. The Traptrix's ability to control 'holes' is very strong. If I don't want to let your planet be destroyed, it can be said that it is easy. Well, like this, bugs must also have a place to live~ I will leave you an area where you can live. With your technology, you should be able to survive in it. What you do next is up to you~'\n\nAs Sera said, she did deliberately leave a place in her intestines. In this place, the feces will rub against this area and be excreted, but it seems that some loopholes were deliberately left. Some unfiltered fecal matter may even directly hit the planet, and [gts_tensi_destroyed_planet.GetName] can only struggle to survive in this harsh environment. Some people on the planet try their best to find a way to leave, while others completely regard Sera as a god, worshiping everything about Sera, even the feces she smashed on the planet due to intestinal activities. They believe that this is the goddess's blessing and punishment. Only by struggling to survive in the intestines can the goddess give them a way to survive, and at the same time hinder those who are looking to escape in every possible way.\n\nHowever, all this is unknown to the green Traptrix - after all, this planet is completely irrelevant to her, just a small episode in her life.
