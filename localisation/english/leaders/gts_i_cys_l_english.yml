  gts_cys_trait1: "Lord of Order"
  gts_cys_trait1_desc: "In the presence of ancient demons, the world's illusions and tricks seem as laughable as a child learning to walk. Of course, there's never a shortage of ignorant and reckless fools."
  gts_cys_trait2: "‘Unlimited’ Galactic Trade"
  gts_cys_trait2_desc: "With the magical prowess akin to black technology, Lady Crystal Orchid can extend her enormous hand across the galaxy, marketing any goods we wish to trade. She could even turn the clients themselves into ‘products’."
  gts_cys_trait3: "Universal Form"
  gts_cys_trait3_desc: "Her mere gestures change the sky, her breath becomes the wind, her gaze penetrates suns and moons-what seems like a grand divine act is just routine for one more ancient than stars."
  gts_cys_trait4: "Final Omen of Death"
  gts_cys_trait4_desc: "Upon our request, Crystal Orchid agreed to embark with our fleet in an armed formation.\n\nThe mysterious energy field in her demonic eyes can instantly decompose an enemy fleet into basic particles or achieve annihilation through sheer physical collision. However, as per her requirements, a high expedite fee is required for a temporary military operation agreement."
  gts_cys_trait5: "Supreme Queen"

  gts_cys_trait5_desc: "The demoness's exacting demands for a refined life force us to scour the universe to provide her with every imaginable luxury. At least it's far better than being her enemy, right?"

  gts_cys.2.name: "Stars Aligned"
  gts_cys.2.desc: "Our brave pioneer fleet discovered a peculiar phenomenon in the star system named §Y‘Libra’§!. Observed from afar, the system resembles an inverted pentagram necklace glowing on black velvet, perfectly aligned and motionless.\n\nOur scientists speculate this exceeds the bounds of scientific understanding. We can mark this location for careful consideration, though the military is more interested in its exploitable value, while the explorers... they just wish to set foot on this enigmatic land as soon as possible."
  gts_cys.2.a: "Observe from a distance"
  gts_cys.2.b: "Planets with resources are the real treasures, time to split"
  gts_cys.2.c: "Future generations benefit from past endeavors"
  gts_cys.100.desc: "§Y[Access Log]§!\n\nWe urgently updated the strategic plan for the Libra system, and you'll need to verify each entry yourself. As you're aware, our future interactions with her are likely to intensify, affecting far more than just ourselves."
  gts_cys.100.a: "[Read Archive]"
  gts_cys.100.a.rt: "§YArchive Record One:§!\n\nThe planetary surfaces in the Libra system are exposed to cosmic conditions, yet there are highly active reactions around the magic formations. Energy operates through some unknown method, seemingly weaving a great web, with nodes at each planet's core. Further study is needed. To harness target energy, we require bases, scholars, and patient support.\n\n§Y[Energy Activity Level] 57%§!\nA magical formation on the star contains the apparent power to catalyze a certain process, the purpose of which is entirely unknown.\n\n§Y[Local Biological Cell Mutation Density] 0.32μ/L§!\nObvious racial mutation phenomena occur on every planet within the system. Such mutations, clearly, don't bode well.\n\n§HI'm so frustrated dealing with those lunatics in the research chamber, while the liaison division finally found Rosinante, who was trying to drown himself in the library. I bluntly told him that, at this rate, the expedition team would never receive funding from headquarters. True, genius implies privilege, but that doesn't afford him the right to flout rules and forcibly demand money! Uh, you ask why I'm writing the funding application for him? Even if my feelings oppose it...a lot of people are relying on him. So, who's going to brave the disdainful glares and remind him of the necessity to make a report to the higher-ups?§!\n- A Senior Fleet Financial Advisor"
  gts_cys.100.b: "[Continue Investigation]"
  gts_cys.101.desc: "§Y[Access Log]§!\n\nWe discovered a notebook left behind by Arkatio Rosinante, filled with obscure markings and strange spellings combining his native tongue and Common. Some sketches similar to blueprints were also found. Due to the frequent blasphemies against management and financial policies, the security department intervened to investigate, bringing in Fleet Advisor Igg Inshe for content interpretation."
  gts_cys.101.a.rt: "§YArchive Record Two:§!\n\nScholars quickly found themselves unwelcome in the system, as the mysterious magical energy surged violently, seemingly intent on tearing everything asunder. From mysteriously malfunctioning research equipment to endless waves of attacks by native inhabitants, and their own increasingly taut nerves.\n\nTheir faith in science would not allow a retreat. Perhaps aim the currently collected energy beams at the star to try.\n\nInshe, after reviewing the notebook on-site, showed a cryptic smile and refused further assistance. Ultimately, under security’s insistence, Mr. Inshe explained the notebook’s content to us.\n\nPlan One: It’s confirmed that energy can trigger gravitational fields forcibly, gradually clearing nodes in the energy field without outside interference, ultimately opening channels to observe the field’s interior. This plan might take a significant portion of the research budget for years; maybe we can secure it, but the surrounding environment is unstable, can we request a few more army units from headquarters for protection?\nTroops arrived but are far from enough, (followed by lengthy, meaningless profanity)\n\nPlan Two: Set an explosive in the middle of the star's giant magic formation. Management loves sending inspectors, expected to coax him over, detonate the explosive, and sever the formation, observing intense energy collision and killing him would surely push headquarters to address funding issues; subsequent experiments can continue.\nNo chance, nobody from HQ even wants to look, (profanity)\n\nPlan Three: A daring gamble, if the entwined strands can’t be untangled, cut the threads before the mutated creatures tear us to shreds-compress collected energy into an extreme beam shot into the magic formation’s center on the star, it's do or die, maybe Inshe would coax a few feudal remnants for a grand send-off, remember to ask him later.\n\nPlan Four......"

  gts_cys.101.b.rt: "Inshe stated the next dozen pages contain much similar content, with detailed action schematics for each plan, including explosive setups and instrument angles. Ignoring some vulgar language directed at management, most plans are sane and feasible. Financial Advisor further informed the security department that subsequent notebook content involved numerous guesses on the magic formation’s principles, hundreds of stellar magic formation analyses adjustments, among other miscellaneous entries.\n\nRegarding Rosinante's mentioned plans to entrap management officers, security agents devised countermeasures and, deeming the notebook no longer threatening, entrusted it back to Inshe, but the advisor refused.\n\n§H“He didn't really insult Inshe this time.”\n\n“Hah, wonder where he picked up this note-taking habit.”§!\n- Conversation in the Corridor"
  gts_cys.102.desc: "§YArchive Record Three:§!\n\nDays later, gravitational fields directed dazzling energy beams through the cosmos, striking the star formation’s center.\n\nInitially, a mere glimmer, gradually a cascade of fireworks adorned the starry sky following the formation’s lines, the central formation flickering enigmatically, releasing scattered mystical glyphs. Soon, the once silent cosmos brightened starkly like a screen turned up midway, with the empty space carved into distinct segments, like a tapestry projected in a vacuum.\n\nOn screen, countless ships and fleets weave over a planet, resembling industrious ants. Towering structures adorn the planetary surface, gleaming metallically, futuristic cities rise into view.\n\nAs if on cue, the fleet waited distantly away from the planet, leaving only a few peculiar small ships scattered around, luminescent purple symbology gathering burgeoning vortexes, expanding massively to a size far surpassing the entire planet.\n\nOff-screen, the expedition fleet merely observed the soon to unravel scene-amid the silent vortex’s purple ripples, a colossal entity emerged, reaching directly for the aligned planet."
  gts_cys.103.desc: "Due to perspective, fleet members quickly identified the figure as an astoundingly graceful hand, moving slowly but inexorably due to its immense scale. Each centimeter advanced brimmed with undeniable strength, evident when delicately halting the planet's free float, becoming evident on screen. Naturally, hands lose detail at such scale, yet this alabaster hand elegantly cradling the bead-like planet showed not a single flaw. Every joint's fold, arch's line, and translucent nail reflecting the planet's engines appeared like the creation of a beauty deity, mesmerizing all present in and outside the image. In a haze, the planet succumbed to the vortex, remnants of stardust trailing its path-a stunning reality, not illusion.\n\nBut this was hardly the end, for within the vortex, that ivory hand stretched once more, fingers spread, conducting a silent symphony. With fluid gestures, starlight gathered in darkness, cosmos sprites danced undercent the commanding index, as newly formed fleets spun elegantly in a cosmic ballet....\n\nConcluding the presentation, the scientist poetically hinted at the divine finale:\n§YEvery warship glowed with mysterious light, brimming with energy. Uniformly arrayed, they resembled a mentally unified legion, poised for any cosmological challenge.\nThis scene played out like a moving symphony, resonating in the vast cosmos, the owner of this divine hand must wield universal control, earning solemn respect. The fleet's potential is unfathomable, heralding future astral shaking warfare. §!"
  gts_cys.104.desc: "§YArchive Record Four:§!\n\nTo ensure crew rest, the fleet spun at speeds simulating standard atmospheric pressure, the maternal reassurance in boundless cold always relaxing.\n\nFeeling weary for once, the man rubbed his cheeks. Yet he waved to activate the data panels, increasing streams of analyzable footage awaited him before his respite.\n\n§BGenerations rise and fall, the earth remains eternal, the sun rises, the sun sets, the sun rises as ever.§!\n\nBefore him sprawled a lush grassland. Dusk descended, the light dull like it was absorbed, everything awaiting engulfment by darkness. Flickering campfires surrounded by entwining runes emanated shadowy purple hue. Naked blondes watched the skies fearfully.\n\nAn existence far grander than planets gazed upon them from cosmic realms, its immense form towering over starry vistas, akin to a mountain lodged in the cosmos. Eyes akin to twin suns appeared in the night; when this entity spoke, its voice resounded through the void, sending shivers through their souls:"
  gts_cys.105.desc: "§r\"You seek wisdom, then rob Yahweh of authority, a treasured collection.\"§!\n\nThis was demonic seduction, a sweet melody laden with insatiable greed and conquest.\n\nScene shifts to a parched grassland, strobes of lightning breaking the sun's shrouded gloom. The world's end awaited an imminent storm. Skies rumbled as if holding a divine wrath. Stifling electric charge crackled in the air with suffocating tension.\n\nThe man's voice, thunderous, boomed across skies:"
  gts_cys.105.a: "§HHe who digs a pit will fall into it. §!"
  gts_cys.106.desc: "This was the highest-information footage recorder-grassland long gone, seemingly eons passed, stars having changed allegiance. A tall altar rose amid orbiting crafts in the clouds, with civilization advanced remarkably. Currently, a ceremony proceeded-\n\nMystic-robed woman lounged by altar, at her feet kneeled a crowd led by a discreet elder.\n\n§r\"So, you desire even more technology, crave broader conquests?\"§!\n\nDeath’s voice laced with allure remained unchanged across eons, as she toyed with an apple, black robe reached the floor, exposing snow-pale skin imbued with an unnatural chill beauty. Despite the cloak's concealment, her figure retained a captivating elegance.\n\nThe elder’s humble agreement prompted followers to present an ornate box, slowly ascending the stairs.\n\n§r\"Your avarice has surpassed your capacity. First for cosmic treasures, then vast resources, even racial lifespans-what remains to trade?\"§!\n\nWith enigmatic foreboding, she ignored the box’s ascent.\n\n§r\"Or perhaps....?\"§!\n\nSuddenly, followers sprang forth, yanking the cover free, lunging away, during those rapid beats, the woman simply watched, a smile playing upon her lips.\n\nCountless particle beams amassed tightly around her vicinity, severing her contact with the outside. Moreover, a sacred psalm reverberated in the air, as golden lightning struck fiercely, fanfare volleyed into the altar, detonating amidst resounding deafening booms.\n\nPerhaps it succeeded as the elder’s grin froze upon his features-\n\n§r\"Reality anchors and.....Yahweh's sacred sword? I knew you dabbled in petty contrivances privately, yet never imagined, despite ancestors' desperate escape from his control...\"§!\n\nSmoke cleared, the woman elegantly dusted non-existent ashes from her chest, complex expression meeting those wielding weapons in desperate revolt, exhaling softly.\n\n§r\"For base desires, sacrifice your freedom and plead before him?\"\n\"Do not deceive yourselves; God is not to be mocked. What a man sows, he also reaps. Bar me not, old man, your toys violated the accords.\"§!\n\nReflecting on the distant hopeful lovers, she idly raised the apple.\n\n§r\"To freedom.\"§!\n\nThen, promptly took a wholehearted bite."
  gts_cys.107.desc: "Even distant observers noticed the anomaly, ground trembling mildly then intensely. Panic surged toward its source, a growing form manifesting, the woman’s form enlarging inexorably, buildings swept aside like waves, crumbling to rubble. Tremors opened ground fissures vast, concealing magma’s ruddy glow. At the chaotic epicenter stood she, unyielding.\n\nUltimately, on screen, the grandly scaled woman cradled the planet basketball-like, her chin pressing an ocean surface, provoking kilometer-high waves, her mere breath upsetting clouds, breasts atop the continent reducing landmarks to powder, inducing cascading flesh waves, snow-white arms encircling the equator. Mere onlookers helplessly watched earth-concealing arms tighten stranglehold, planet surface adorned with webbed fractures, crevasses slowly expanding, planetary core emerging, unprotected populace voided their last glimpse of this awe.......\n\nMolten lava splashed cosmically like icing, adorning the giant form like luminous paint, mingling with debris, shipwrecks, shattered mountain fragments, oceans freezing fast. Yet she silently gazed upon it all, voicing a gentle awe.\n\nThe frame froze on her exquisite visage, offscreen, the man stood quietly."
  gts_cys.108.desc: "§YArchive Record Five:§!\n\n[Audio Log]\n\n§HI saw your note, boss. Frankly, the Libra incident left you intrigued by \"her.\" You wouldn’t have sought me otherwise.\n\nDuring the dawn of exploration, daily academia centered upon the enigmatic entity, Rosinante tirelessly chaired meetings, theorizing, up to the present.\n\n“She” excels at commerce, likely brushings with other-dimensional beings. Obliterating planets physically? Part of the fine lifestyle. Generally, she decomposes foes instantly, unthinkable as a glance decimates entire fleets?\n\nIn essence, any idea you conjure, she executes; the unimaginable, she also accomplishes. My advice: refrain from excessive detail-your evenings as a commander are priceless, better not squander them on nightmares. By the way, her presence, here-I only heard once, speculated mostly, perhaps you should query Inshe, perhaps he possesses insight.§!\n\n--■■■\n\n\n§HSorry, in this matter, I have little to disclose, Mr.\n\nAs a finance advisor, what I can share is her interest in “trades”, after compressing the latest recordings, we opted for prudent caution in approach and strategy.

  gts_cys.108.a.rt: "§HI heard from Inshe, you're prying into the lady's secrets; you're ever curious.\n\nDirectly ask me; there’s no need to hide-from you. Perhaps call her a merchant, neutral yet reliable, capable of obliterating foes, us included.\n\n……\n\nAlright, enough questions at once-one by one.\n\nFirstly, she seemingly attended a great war’s spectacle, a... lively final feast.\n\n……No, not her intention; a terminated commerce era is her regretted void, I harbor no doubt. Imagine-cosmic resources diverted wholly to warables eradicate commerce, this vocative profession for resource redistribution underlies cosmic discards. A rudimentary economics knowledge. The conflict not political continuation but pure binary of survival alone.\n\nStar tides rise, fleet armadas emit beacons; intertwining clashes, grav waves ripple cascades, vibrating cosmos. Fighting persisted, senses blurred in survival instinct…..a restart button inevitably presses then?\n\nHer form might be stupendous as stars, fleets mere dust amid her flank’s sweep, obliterating swathes, even escape space absent, yielding to explodes beneath her; what for us amounts to flames scaling sparsely hundreds of meters.\n\nIn closure, her raised hand, as if a galactic spiral arm-musical notes as celestial objects trace orbit, meteor paths submit to her as sole important celestial body, reversed pentacles align behind in brilliance, she contracts inward, spins, pausing all around, electromagnetic projectiles mid-course burn to ash……ultimately, an eternally fixed star system, presently debated.\n\nOh, one last question......\n\n......\n\n......\n\nIndeed, very grand-and unarguably beautiful.§!\n\n--Rosinante"

  gts_cys.109.a.rt: "The scarred star reduced to flickering remnants, without forewarning, withdrawing base staff found equipment decay into atmospheric grey particles, swiftly overtaking cries, the star burst, its disintegration scything silently, an efficient massacre.\n\nStar debris pierced retreating fleet, shattered hull ejected crew, minor belongings, those fortunate activated space suits whereas others incinerated in drive exhaust, detonation screams pealed reminiscent of ignited pyrotechnic chain.\n\nInshe deftly executed commands with executors, navigating stellar detritus seeking escape from impending doom. Lacking energy nor focus on stellar truth lay bare, yet pervasive cold dread climbed each spine-that deep-seeded primal fear facing a superior order-\n\nStellar remnant expelled brilliant luminosity, a dazzling purplish hue central stage aligned, engulfing all light ravenously, akin to spotlight on the protagonist. Inevitably glancing backward, only deeper despair awaited."
  gts_cys.110.desc: "A gigantic figure surfaced from planetary fissures like an awakened ancient divine beast. The demon’s Aspect-a pair of eyes deep as black holes, exerting weighty pressure and mystifying aura, seeming to pierce souls.\n\nEnergetic fluctuations grew violently, threatening full planetary collapse, consuming the cosmos. The survey vessel gave utmost endeavor escaping peril territory, yet remained under Crystal Orchid’s gaze, her eyes felt perennial markers.\n\nFinally, those frenzied demon eyes cleared, objectively a split second, subjectively an eternity, souls seemingly reunited, bathed in cold sweat and residual dread.\n\nRosinante propped upright, squinting at the suddenly close queen, leg pain reminded dignity's cost; laughter escaped him-a record laughable day.\n\n§H\"Such a historied moment, Inshe didn't help prep me at all.\"§!"
