  gts_hoppo.1.name: "Missing Freighter"
  gts_hoppo.1.desc: "One of our freighters, a large cargo vessel, recently went missing in the outer reaches of our empire, sending out only a brief distress signal before communication was lost. While concerning, it wasn't cause for extreme alarm given the volatile nature of the local star systems... until now.\n\nOne of our advisors reports that the ship has been frantically attempting to contact us – the crew are adamantly insisting on a direct comms connection to our leader, [Root.Leader.GetName]. Permission has been granted, and the screen finally flickers to life."
  gts_hoppo.1.a: "Connection established. Freighter, what is your status?"
  gts_hoppo.2.desc: "The other end of the comm remains silent for too long; though from the audio, one can hear the distant blare of alarms and the groan of metal being crushed, the screen only shows static. Our call goes unanswered, only the sounds of a ship groaning under unknown strain. \n\n However, this isn't what some were hoping or expecting: when sound comes from the speakers again, the array crackles, having received a volume well beyond its specifications. Clearly, this voice is not pleased. \n\n The voice is that of a young girl, though it carries an otherworldly echo, it is both sweet and cute; if the volume wasn't enough of a warning, then the displeasure in the words certainly is by now.\n\n§R“I told you I wanted to speak to your leader, didn't I? Why isn't the screen properly working? Are you dumb? Do you want to get squished?”§!\n\nThe last we hear are the desperate pleas of the crew and their panicked orders; but again, no one actually answers our questions. For a moment, the sounds of grinding metal and crackling cables fill our comms channel before they abruptly cut off…"
  gts_hoppo.2.a: "Freighter? Freighter, what is happening?"
  gts_hoppo.3.desc: "...The screen finally flickers into life again.\n\nThe bridge of the freighter is utterly wrecked: sections of the flight consoles are exploding into sparks and flames, the whole room bathed in firelight and the red hue of emergency lights; objects lay scattered, anything not bolted to the floor has been sent flying into walls that themselves have been warped, pipes torn apart, and wires frayed, scattering sparks around. Several members of the crew are weakly groaning on the ground and attempt to crawl away; others are motionless, like ragdolls, tossed aside.\n\nYet, outside the shattered bridge viewport, her eyes stare directly at the camera.\n\nThough separated by a considerable distance from the freighter, her eyes are the only fully visible part of her body, with the skin around them exceptionally smooth and white, while the eyes themselves are round, curious, and red. She stares at the bridge with a strange mix of excitement and boredom.\n\nThen the ship is shaken again as the crew continue to struggle, more cracks appear in the bridge windows, and she begins to speak again, the speakers still protesting at the sheer volume.\n\n§R“Let’s get started! I've heard of you. [Root.Leader.GetName] of [Root.GetName], and I heard that you found some stuff that could help my sister. Can I come over there? I just want to talk! Maybe we can help each other?”§!\n\n\nShe just wants to talk, right? Somehow, amongst the screams and whimpers of the crew, that doesn't sound all that convincing. On the other hand, she does sound kind of cute. Perhaps you could trust her?"
  gts_hoppo.3.a: "...Alright. You may pay a visit. Now, about that ship--"
  gts_hoppo.3.a.tooltip: "§H...Are you sure about this? She sounds §Rreally§! trustworthy?§!"
  gts_hoppo.3.b: "How about a planet instead? I think [event_target:gts_hoppo_target_desert_planet.GetName] would be suitable."
  gts_hoppo.4.name: "Inviting the Wolf into the House"
  gts_hoppo.4.desc: "While one cannot see her mouth, the mirth in her eyes is enough to show that she is highly amused at the response-enough, maybe for [Root.Leader.GetName] to reconsider the decision. However, there is no time for any more retractions: the girl’s voice crashes through the afflicted freighter again, her tone very cheerful.\n\n§R“Yay! Okay then, [Root.Leader.GetName], see you soon! We’re going to have so much fun together.”§!\n\nIn that instant, the comms are overtaken by the deafening roar of metal grinding and glass shattering, laced with the frantic screams of the freighter's crew. The screen abruptly cuts to black, and all connection with the stricken vessel is lost. What has happened is beyond all doubt, but on the other hand, one begins to wonder what comes next. No-one is certain they like the most likely answer."
  gts_hoppo.4.a: "...Can we evacuate an entire planet? Is that even possible?"
  gts_hoppo.5.name: "Barred at the Door"
  gts_hoppo.5.desc: "While one cannot see her mouth, her partially closed eyes are enough to show that she is highly displeased with the response-more than enough to make [Root.Leader.GetName] thoroughly suspicious they may have dodged a bullet. However, the girl doesn't seem about to object to one's request: that clear voice crashes through the afflicted freighter again, her tone one of displeasure.\n\n§R“...Ugh, fine. Whatever. *grumbles*, I'll see you there, [Root.Leader.GetName]. As you wish. What a bummer.”§!\n\nIn that instant, the comms are overtaken by the deafening roar of metal grinding and glass shattering, laced with the frantic screams of the freighter's crew. The screen abruptly cuts to black, and all connection with the stricken vessel is lost. What has happened is beyond all doubt, but on the other hand, one begins to wonder what comes next. No-one is certain they like the most likely answer, but everyone has a nagging feeling that it *could* have been worse."
  gts_hoppo.5.a: "...Well, things could rapidly get very messy."
  gts_hoppo.6.name: "Stepping into Our Realm"
  gts_hoppo.6.desc: "Tense days pass since that fateful encounter. As for the freighter - well, no-one was surprised when we finally located a flattened metal disk floating in space, with only a few scraps of paint suggesting the origin of that cargo ship, and no attempt was made to rescue the crew, because really, would anybody even survive?\n\nBut, such tension pales in comparison to the situation in the days that followed. Defence ministers and admirals discussed at length what they could even do against a girl who could effortlessly crush ships with her fingers, and who was tens of thousands times the size of us. The answer was clear: nothing. Plans were drawn up to evacuate the capital complexes, station defences were upgraded, fleets were marshaled, and personnel were drilled, and all that remains now is to hope it would somehow end all well.\n\nThose hopes are brutally crushed as a crackling hyperspace portal appears on the edge of the system which eventually tears open into a fissure kilometers wide. When space is finally broken to allow the massive traveler through, we finally see the girl in her entirety: white skin, white hair, orange-red eyes, a petite and childlike build, snow-white gloves and bare feet, wearing an entirely white dress, nothing more. When one sees unlucky passing ships explode against her skin with not even a reaction; when asteroids are crushed or flicked out of the system like flies and she doesn't even notice it; everyone knows, that even as prepared as they were for a girl who was tens of thousands of times bigger than them-it's nothing compared to this scale of difference.\n\n§R“Hello, [Root.Leader.GetName]! I'm here to play, just like we decided!”§!\n\nAs her eyes sparkle and her smile is all-encompassing, you can't help but wonder what you can do against a girl four million times bigger than you."
  gts_hoppo.6.a: "Damn it, we won't go down without a fight! All fleets in the system, engage immediately!"
  gts_hoppo.6.b: "There's nothing we can do. We can only let her land, brace for impact, and hope for the best."
  gts_hoppo.7.desc: "In the planet's capital complex, the defense minister and naval admirals locked eyes before nodding in unison, a brief and beautiful moment of solidarity. yes, there was only one thing that they could do. They had no choice but to try to stop her. Through courage and determination, they could do it. They could win.\n\nThe fleets then arranged themselves in a line before the colossal target, their weapons beginning to warm up, shields charging...\n\n...That beautiful moment shattered the instant the girl laid eyes on their fleets, and smiled.\n\n§R“...Yes. Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I hoped you’d choose this, but, but.... Thank you!”§!\n\nThat fleeting moment shattered into utter panic as her sweet, caring smile spread into a delighted grin.\n\n§R“Let’s play, little ships~”§!"
  gts_hoppo.7.a: "...That was a mistake."
  gts_hoppo.8.name: "The Fleet is Defeated"
  gts_hoppo.8.desc: "No one was surprised by the result, but that did nothing to make the fact easier to accept.\n\nBefore long, there wasn't a friendly fleet left in the system. Perhaps some of the vessels managed to escape or hide, but [Root.Leader.GetName] held no great hopes for such possibilities. What *was* certainly clear was that the girl was hovering near [Root.Capital.GetName] - hard to miss, seeing as she could be seen from an entire hemisphere. In her hands, she held a few pieces of wreckage - space stations, and defense platforms that had been plucked from their locations like berries, their armor crushed like tinfoil in her rough grip. The defense forces in space were rapidly dwindling as she was popping them into her mouth two or three at a time, chewing them with a happy expression.\n\nAs for the ships, well. They were too small to be worth it. Some were crushed with a clap of her hands, others were ground into dust by her curious fingers. Some were accidentally inhaled into her body, never to leave, never to be noticed. and even for the larger targets, including several of the defensive flagship, a simple flex of her toes was all it took, the soft pads compressing the massive hulls into tiny smears of molten metal.\n\nAnd the worst part of it all was, her expression, because she looked…disappointed.\n\n\n\n§R“…Mmm. So boring~ I thought you’d be better than that. I even gave you time to prepare.”§!\n\nAs she tossed the last of the defense platforms into her mouth, a dozen communication channels were cut instantly as she thoughtfully chewed the heavy armor, as if its density was nothing. But then she smiled, her gaze fixed onto the planet below.\n\n§R“Just an appetizer, I suppose. Be you ready or not, here I come~”§!"
  gts_hoppo.8.a: "Brace for Impact! Brace for Impact! Brace for I--"
  gts_hoppo.9.name: "Hard Landing"
  gts_hoppo.9.desc: "There was no practical way to prepare for an impact like that.\n\nThe girl did not land directly onto the planet's surface, because that action would cause the total destruction of the planet. But, even the slow of the soft soles of her feet made little difference. As the red glow of the superheated atmosphere lit up her skin, she showed no signs of discomfort; tiny, pinprick explosions hinting at hundreds of satellites being destroyed in her wake, the impact of which was too minor for her to even notice.\n\nWhat should be expected - the atmosphere being compressed under her feet would cause storms the planet had never seen, with trees, buildings, vehicles, asphalt, concrete, and countless residents, all being swept up into it at a speed that would pulverise them into fragments and dust.\n\nBut, this did not happen because the girl was simply too big, her feet too wide, and descending too fast.\n\nThe atmosphere is simply unable to escape and is rapidly compressed to extreme levels. The pressure is so high that people would begin to burst like balloons while buildings would begin to collapse as they are forced into the ground and if allowed to continue, all that would remain of the earth would be a flat plain of unbelievably compressed matter.\n\nHowever, there is no time for this to occur, for the girl's feet finally touch down.\n\nThe atmosphere compresses so rapidly, it reaches levels that trigger a nuclear reaction. Everything under those soft surfaces - every building, every mountain, every living creature - is crushed together in an instant. From rock to concrete to metal to every material that forms life melt together and in another moment, that liquid is superheated into vapor. And the cities that are lucky not to be directly under that 800-kilometer-wide foot are instantly destroyed in groaning and fractured earth, while the white-hot clouds of vapor from those first victims would scourge everything within 300 kilometers surrounding it.\n\nThere would not be any accurate official statistics for this first event – simply too much else would be going on - but upwards of hundreds of millions died because a girl simply stepped onto the planet.\n\nSoon they would have plenty of company."
  gts_hoppo.9.a: "*There is no response from the capital building - only the sounds of groaning metal and collapsing masonry*"
  gts_hoppo.10.name: "Crossroads"
  gts_hoppo.10.desc: "If that girl was in a hurry to get to our capital complex, she certainly did not show it.\n\nHer steps were slow and measured, albeit with barely contained excitement: she was clearly aware that if she decided to just start running around at random, the planet would probably not last a minute or two.\n\nOf course, this did nothing to reduce her devastation. With each kiss of her smooth soles against the crust, hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of land just…vanished. It would be impossible to tell what was ever there, and while this certainly included the works of our civilization, even the great natural structures would be gone so they would not stand a chance. The highest mountain in the world, capturing the imagination of countless for millennia, finally conquered by brave mountaineers thanks to centuries of attempts - held her bare foot for only an instant as it was compressed and melted into lava, pushed tens of kilometers into the mantle. The girl was doing nothing, merely trodding on it, and turned the highest part of the world into the deepest basin on Earth-though this wasn't so unique, there are plenty of those now on this planet.\n\nOf course, the cities didn't fare any better - and really, if the girl wasn't actively looking for them she probably wouldn't even notice stepping onto them.\n\nUnfortunately, she *did* notice. She did notice the tiny grey stains calling themselves ‘metropolises’. No matter how big they are, no matter how storied their past, no matter how many people called them home – she cared only about how to wipe them out.\n\nSome of those cities she did not dwell on. A great port city, situated amongst a coastal bay, with countless ships heading from it to send goods across the world was an important center for traffic in this vast region. And in a sudden roar and the ensuing earth tremors, the bay became much bigger - much, much bigger, the new bay shaped very much like the five toes of her foot along with its front pad.  Ships, infrastructure, vehicles that once traveled across the world, they were now moving faster than ever before – though as dust and specks stuck to her sole and moved by her footsteps.\n\nOthers, she found amusing. A cultural hub, home to some of the largest museums outside of the capital complex, its long history surviving wars and natural catastrophes with its precious memories of our civilization intact: But none of this earned the girl’s respect as she simply scratched the entire region away with her toes. Castles, palaces, ruins, monuments - the whole region became compressed into tiny mounds the size of her toes as she moved, more insignificant victims under her toenails.\n\nShe heard that this region was home to the world’s best cooking technology. That its signature dishes have travelled around the globe, through even our empire. Quality ingredients, grown carefully to achieve the best tastes, combined with a long history of culinary tradition to form wondrous meals: She simply *had* to try some, you know? She laid down, an action that instantly eradicated numerous less interesting cities and countless insignificant ‘germs’. And as she stood back up, merely brushing off the residue of an entire sub-continent off her dress and continued her travels she ultimately concluded  she could not feel the appeal of the cuisine, only leaving behind a few giant craters left by her tongue lapping onto it embedded into the crust of the planet, the craters caked in spit and the occasional scraps of civilization.\n\nAnd finally, as she reached the other side of the world -  a regional capital of forty million people, a spectacular economic hub that was crushed into nothing under her curious toes - her smile grew ever larger. She moved carefully for a few steps (carefully as in causing minimal tremors, though this made no major difference to the areas directly under her feet) now finally arriving at the capital complex. She stopped, slowly crouched to get closer. It did nothing - her face was still thousands of kilometers away in the sky.\n\nHer voice, a mere whisper, shattered every window in the region, weaker buildings collapsing into plumes of dust that were immediately dispelled by the frighteningly loud sound. Even if she noticed, she did not care.\n\n\n\n§R“Hello, [Root.Leader.GetName] ! Sorry, your planet was too cute, I simply had to play with it. But, mmm…yes! I've come to offer you a deal.”§!\n\nShe became more serious, a look of concentration spreading across her face.\n\n§R“I heard that you guys invented something that can make things smaller. My sister needs it! See, she loves breaking stuff. She always tells me stories of breaking things. But now she's too big and everything is so small it barely exists. So! If you made her smaller, she can break stuff again - and she can break stuff for you that you want destroyed.”§!\n\nShe opened her arms excitedly: a small fleet of ships, completely unnoticed, on an evac mission did not even get a chance to realize what was happening as they were wiped out by the sleeve of her glove.\n\n§R“So, [Root.Leader.GetName]? Good deal, right? It’s great, right? You guys are going to love how good my big sis is at wiping out anything she wants!”§!\n\nThe advisors, shocked, confused, and borderline deaf, stared at this happy, godlike child, who after erasing almost three billion lives for fun, was asking for our help. Do we…do we want to help her? More importantly are we willing to risk ticking her off by refusing?"
  gts_hoppo.10.a: "Can we speak with your \"big sister\"?"
  gts_hoppo.10.b: "You monster. Crush us if you must, but we won't make any deals with you."
  gts_hoppo.10.tooltip: "§ROur capital has already suffered massive losses in lives and destroyed buildings, but even more horrific events may occur with another bad choice. Choices are painful, but it shouldn't end like this.§!"
  gts_hoppo.11.name: ""
  gts_hoppo.11.desc: "The girl tilted her head, falling into thought.\n\n§R“You know that my sister, Harbor, has been watching you, right? But she cannot speak, because just her breathing would kill you all. She is too big for you guys.”§!\n\nThere was a visible sense of panic in the meeting chamber. What did the girl mean? Was this ‘Harbor’ invisible? Was she hiding somewhere? Were there some spy satellites or secret weapons in orbit?\n\nThe young, white giant seemed to notice – she giggled softly, the shockwave from which caused the planet’s capital complex to shift slightly.\n\n§R“Oh, you’re trying to look for her here? You silly little things, you'd never see her from *down there*!”§!\n\nHer arms shifted, pointing up to the stars above.\n\n§R“See? She's there, she's *there*!”§!\n\nIt took a few seconds for our vision to adjust: our eyes darted back and forth trying to find the twinkle of a moving satellite, or even the vague outline of an enormous, celestial giantess. It was not until one managed to focus on the faint smear of orange, looking almost like a nebula from the surface, and all the pieces came together and our breathing stilled in that moment, finally realizing the true meaning behind the girl's words. We looked too low, looked too small.\n\nFrom the depths of space, her eyes gazed back at us.  An almost bored sense of tired apathy, one that comes from someone who has done the same thing a thousand times, yet knows that this was still be the first thousand and first failure; there is kindness too, that comes from the eye looking down on something that was so cute, and so small, so fragile; but also, more ominously, there was a deep burning predatory desire, the intense focus of a killer studying their next victim.\n\nAll that anyone could register was that eyes above and beyond the sky, beyond their world were looking at the council. In fact, beyond any star. Scientists would (unhelpfully) note that her eyes were not *of* their galaxy.  They stared in horror at that ‘nebula’ as even her eyelash could in an instance tear through the puny galaxy, turning billions of stars into sub-atomic matter in an instant. Everyone in the room knew that this being that defied everything science knew about lightspeed and other absolute limits was...looking at them. They simply recalled how one thought to discuss rejecting the girl’s proposal and even potentially insulting her.\n\nThe implications of what *could* happen in that instance is almost madness-inducing.\n\nAnd yet, they recovered. They had to. This…this deal just had to be completed, as soon as possible. “We were in danger” was a definition far too simple for the situation.\n\n\n\nThe required hormones were gathered - a breathtaking quantity, it goes without saying. We anxiously wondered whether it was enough, but it seemed the girl was very confident it would work. It was loaded into an empty cargo ship, the white titan girl holding its tiny shell with care. Finally, she was ready to leave. She gave a cheerful wave, before looking up at her sister's eyes, spanning the sky.\n\n§R“...Mmm. It’s going to take looong at that size. Maybe I should…”§!"
  gts_hoppo.11.a: "Bon Voyage! May you meet with your sister soon--"
  gts_hoppo.11.b: "Wait, Wait. If you're going to get bigger, please leave this planet first? Okay?"
  gts_hoppo.12.name: ""
  gts_hoppo.12.desc: "That wish would never come to pass.\n\nThe girl nodded with a soft smile. Then, in a moment that would inspire brief terror in everyone – in the same hemisphere as her - she §Ygrew§!. \n\nThis was not an explosion, as few weapons would ever reach this level of magnitude or impact. Like an unstoppable tide, her pale skin rolled over the crust of the earth, compressing and disintegrating  the surface like a thin film of dust. Hundreds of cities were swallowed whole every moment,  ripped from the ground like granules of earth, pulverized into atoms; their remains scattered over her toes, between the gaps and under the toenails - soil that was once home to so many, and is now simply dirt.\n\nThe oceans were likewise crushed under her feet, the barely wet film being but a few millimeters for her; ships that made the journey simply never had the time to slowly sink , as they were immediately compressed into the sea bed, itself dissolving into nothingness in another second.\n\nPlanes, flying among the clouds, saw the sky darken briefly before their entire existence ceased: though her toe never left the ground, the curvature of the planet gave them a brief moment in air as the soft pads of her toes took their place between them and their sky, before the toes rolled back into contact with the ground once more.\n\nAs the girl stretched her body, removing the fatigue from her back from being restrained into her former size, her ten toes lovingly gripped the apple-sized sphere, the whole hemisphere swallowed under a small section of her sole. And the marks she had left before, the unbelievable damage to the crust predicted to last for billions of years, were erased in another instant.\n\nIt is finally over, her legs flexed slightly and she took a soft leap into space. The tremors from her leap would still ravage the surface for days.  As the survivors watched the 300,000-kilometer-tall girl fly away, the remains of half of their planet stuck to her sole, half of its inhabitants, half of its creations, and half of their dreams, we could only conclude that it could, and perhaps even should have been worse.\n\nWe're unsure if this will make the situation better or worse."
  gts_hoppo.12.a: "...What can we do? We will rebuild our homes. Hopefully the help of that *Harbor* will compensate for our losses."
  gts_hoppo.12.tooltip: "§REverything was crushed. It's not game over, but it's real suffering.§!"
  gts_hoppo.13.name: ""
  gts_hoppo.13.desc: "Panic ensued as the figure approached our capital planet.\n\nAnd why wouldn't it? Sure, the Empire was already familiar with the large white titan girl from just a few days prior, with her happy smile and seemingly humming to herself ( though in space, we could not hear what she was hummin).  And that was already enough to warrant some concern all by itself. \n\nThe real issue, the thing causing genuine panic, was that she was not alone. Yes: she was not alone.\n\nIn fact, she was sitting on a hand. well, this statement is a bit of a simplification: she was sitting in the grip of a giant claw, as white as bleached bone, and oddly shaped and irregular in form. Her body barely registered against the size of the palm. The appendage belonged to another girl.\n\nShe, too, shared the same pale skin, nothing more than something resembling a very revealing ribbed sweater.  Her long white hair flowed in the air, moved by currents that clearly didn't exist; her exceptionally voluminous body, barely contained by what one would generously call clothing, bounced softly with each movement she made, soft and springy. As mentioned prior her arms terminated into huge claws - huge not only in absolute size but in *proportional* size as well; on her bare feet, the long black nails covered the toes resembling claws.\n\nOn her forehead was a single black horn with glowing bands of red, bathing her face in an uncanny light; and on her neck,  a tall and thick collar that covered the space from the top of her cleavage to the base of her face. In the middle of it all, those pair of glowing, orange eyes that just days prior stared down at the planet from outside the galaxy.\n\nShe came to a stop before the capital world, her 200,000-kilometer form filling the sky of half of the hemisphere; then, she gave a slight bow."
  gts_hoppo.13.a: "...Welcome to our empire."
