  # Recruitment Text
  NAME_gts_satori: "Koishi Komeiji"
  gts_satori_desc: "The youkai Satori, with her mind-reading abilities and mistress of the Palace of the Earth Spirits, has come to our empire, her titan-sized form searching for her even larger sister."
  gts_satori_catch_phrase: "I wonder where my sister is playing..."
  gts_satori.99.name: "Establishing Communication"
  gts_satori.99.desc.1: "§R-Ah, there are too many people here. Let me digest this information-§!\n\nAcross the thousands of miles of cold, empty space, a lazy and gentle voice of a young girl resonates directly in our minds. This experience is shared, resonated, and elevated by each individual among us.\n\nIt turns out that she wasn’t glaring at us out of anger, but has rather been lost in thought with her eyes unfocused."
  gts_satori.99.desc.2: "§R-Ah, there are too many people here. Let me digest this information-§!\n\nAcross the thousands of miles of cold, empty space, a lazy and gentle voice of a young girl resonates directly in our minds. This is an experience that one cannot imagine from reading a report.\n\nIt turns out that she wasn’t glaring at us out of anger, but has rather been lost in thought with her eyes unfocused."
  gts_satori.99.a: "...I feel somewhat saved."
  gts_satori.99.a.response: "§R-Well, let me introduce myself first. I'm Koishi Komeiji, and I'm currently searching for my missing sister-\n\n-Yes, the one even larger than me, who left all sorts of boot prints on planets, causing what you call a Category VI Stellar Disaster-§!"
  gts_satori.99.b: "Telepathy cannot be used for this..."
  gts_satori.99.b.response: "§R-Can't I use telepathy to find her? No, my ability isn't like your psionics-\n\n-Rather than psionics, I'd prefer that you remember my race's name-\n\n-A Satori Youkai-§!"
  gts_satori.99.c: "A Youkai? In this era where we can resurrect even dinosaurs by extracting their genes..."
  gts_satori.99.c.response: "§R-Details later, I'm here today to return the research ship I borrowed. Don’t worry, everyone on board is fine-§!\n\nThe titan-sized giantess speaks while taking a small ship from her loose sleeve, which looks like a toy in her palm. Except for the dents where her palm prints are, the ship is virtually undamaged. Of course, the crew all had to mandatorily undergo five cycles of giantess PTSD treatment to return back to duty.\n\n§R-Also, could you allow me to join your organization and act together in this universe from now on?-§!"
  gts_satori.99.d: "A Youkai? From what we know, such individuals can never be assimilated into a group, they are an anomaly among anomalies..."

  gts_satori.99.e: "Eh? Eh?"
  # Anomaly Descriptions
  gts_extension_leader_satori: "Shadow in the Deep Space"

  gts_extension_anomaly_leader_satori_desc: "There are countless jumbled enormous boot prints on the surface of this planet, which can be visibly discerned from space. Although this is unremarkable, it is still worth investigating and documenting into the database as a matter of course."
  gts_extension_leader_lyxx: "A Strange, Super-Powerful Psychic Storm"

  gts_extension_anomaly_leader_lyxx_desc: "We detected an unknown psionic signal in the [From.system.GetName] system, comparable in power to a cosmic storm, seemingly emanating from a single, independent lifeform."
  # Special Project Texts
  satori.project: "A Faint Hope"
  satori.project_DESC: "A research ship that went missing several months ago left behind a weak-signal transmitter in the asteroid belt of its last known system. We need to recover the transmitter and analyze it as soon as possible to find out if there is a clue that can save the crew."
  satori.project2: "From a Forgotten World"
  satori.project2_DESC: "The mysterious titan-sized giantess had previously been traveling freely between star systems through some form of psychic method, which made tracking almost impossible. With enough recorded star system coordinates, we can attempt to reverse engineer her jump method and perhaps even manufacture a corresponding early warning device."
  # Events
  gts_satori.1.name: "Shadow in the Deep Space"
  gts_satori.1.desc: "Our research ship has completed its first round of remote sensing work in the high orbit of the planet. Each of these boot prints is hundreds of kilometers long, completely destroying the original terrain in their vicinities. The planet suffered a very typical Category VI Giantess Disaster, also known as a Stellar Disaster. When a giantess of this size steps on the ground, the enormous impact, which is difficult to estimate, can cause significant plate drifting and compression, resulting in countless old volcanic eruptions and new mountain formations.\n\nIn short, for most non-giantess lifeforms, the planet will no longer be habitable. Before that, more than 99.9% of the local life will die under the trampling and secondary disasters caused by the giantess.\n\nUnfortunately, this is something that we cannot foresee or prevent. After repeated comparisons with the database, this is another titan-sized giantess that is not in our records. Computer simulations show that this stellar disaster happened less than five years ago, and it is recommended to increase the risk rating by one to four levels when acting in neighboring star systems in the future.\n\nNext, our research ship will land on the surface for a salvage operation to record the local civilizations."
  gts_satori.1.a: "Let it be"
  gts_satori.1.b: "Collect as many civilization fragments as possible"
  gts_satori.2.name: "Titan-sized Girl"
  gts_satori.2.desc: "The gravity wave detectors suddenly blare an alarm. Our research ship immediately aborted its descent and switched to an emergency retreat program controlled by the shipboard AI. In the 7.5 minutes needed for the hyperdrive to activate, we can only pray that the author of the stellar disaster has not returned to the scene on a whim.\n\nThe research ship's optical sensors show a huge girl with a sky-blue top, another eye on her chest, and slippers on her feet suddenly appearing from the other side of the planet, as if she had been lurking on the planet’s dark side all along.\n\n...But, why slippers?\n\nI don't know. It’s not strange that, a girl so massive that she can appear directly in the optical sensor feed would treat space like her living room.\n\nAccording to our professional research crew's urgent calculations, this giantess is much smaller than the one that caused the stellar disaster below, but still meets the standards for a titan-sized lifeform. Therefore, the shipboard AI will continue the retreat process, which has the highest chances to save our precious crew."
  gts_satori.2.a: "Keep calm, don't provoke this lady"
  gts_satori.2.b: "Call for fire support, aim at her third eye, which may be a weak point"
  gts_satori.3.name: "First Contact"
  gts_satori.3.desc: "§R-You tiny little guys are very interesting-§!\n\nThen something incredible happened. The unnamed giant girl did not connect to any public or private channels. Instead, she directly communicated with every member of our research ship through a psychic-like method.\n\n§R-How did I do it? I'm sure you little guys must have that question-§!\n\nThe giant girl said this and bent down while floating on one side of the planet. A strong sense of oppression immediately poured into the research ship through the optical sensors.\n\n§Y... Hyperdrive, abort.§!\n\nThe cold, emotionless voice of the shipboard AI suddenly echoed in the ship, as if it had been entangled with some kind of shadow. A crew member in the control room seemed to have collapsed under the pressure of facing the titan-sized giantess and forcibly terminated the emergency retreat program. But can that be explained by this act of collapsing?\n\n§R-Explanations later. For now, please allow me to borrow this ship and your crew for a moment-§!\n\nThe last data returned by our research ship was a giant palm approaching each array lens of the optical sensors, and the screams of all crew members on board."
  gts_satori.3.a: "Abandon ship! Abandon ship!"
  gts_satori.4.name: "First Contact"
  gts_satori.4.desc: "With final authorization from the chain of command and headquarters, the available fire units in the same star system as the research ship launched a precise long-range strike against the unknown titan-sized giantess, hoping to buy our research ship some valuable time to complete the retreat procedure.\n\nThen something incredible happened. The unnamed giant girl evaded each round of fire in space with unimaginable agility and graceful movements, without any propulsion device.\n\n§R-Hmph, what a barbaric way to greet guests-§!\n\nAt the same time, the giant girl also communicated with all the crew members on our research ship by some psychic means. The giant girl's power, beyond anything anyone could imagine, and her slight pout have made everyone on site want to cry and beg for mercy.\n\n§R-As punishment, I'll confiscate this ship for now-§!\n\nThe hyperdrive, which was supposed to be the last straw, has also stopped on the 3:10 countdown. Which stupid crew member with authority did this!?\n\n§R-You tiny little guys, please come with me-§!\n\nThe last data returned by our research ship was a giant palm approaching each array lens of the optical sensors, and the screams of all crew members on board."
  gts_satori.4.a: "Abandon ship! Abandon ship!"
  gts_satori.5.name: "A Faint Hope"
  gts_satori.5.desc: "A research ship that went missing several months ago left behind a weak-signal transmitter in the asteroid belt of its last known system. We need to recover the transmitter and analyze it as soon as possible to find out if there is a clue that can save the crew."
  gts_satori.5.a: "Let's begin."
  gts_satori.6.name: "A Faint Hope"
  gts_satori.6.desc: "After some time searching, our engineering ship successfully recovered the transmitter. It is worth noting that there is a significant unnatural gap in the asteroid belt, which should be the mark of the giantess directly crashing through. In this vast space, an asteroid belt that is full of danger for lightly armored ships, is like dust that can be easily swept away for a giantess. The difference in power and position between the two is so large that there is no hope to bridge the gap, even if a miracle occurs. \n\nAll the evidence points to one conclusion: that the giantess, for some unknown motive, kidnapped our research ship and crew that she encountered by chance. Fortunately, our brave crew members managed to leave some messages secretly, which at least proves that they are still alive at this moment. Also, the data extracted from the transmitter is mostly complete and consists of a set of coordinates of star systems they have lingered at, and an audio recording.\n\nVoiceprint analysis shows that the audio recording was indeed made by several of our research crew members in turns, with no unknown voiceprint features. Each recording lasts for a very short amount of time, and the emotional fluctuations are severe. The crew must have been under some kind of constant surveillance for the past few months, suffering unimaginable psychological stress."
  gts_satori.6.a: "Play the recording"
  gts_satori.7.desc: "\n\nShhh... Zzz... \n\nWe're still alive... at least for now.\n\nThe hostile giantess didn't destroy the ship's power unit... she just picks up the ship like a pebble, goes around and comes to different planets, then let go.\n\nBut we still couldn't see even a glimmer of hope of escaping... from under her eyelids...\n\nThe above is what one crew member said with an extremely muffled voice, seemingly wanting to avoid being heard by the giantess or the rest of the crew."
  gts_satori.7.a: "Continue playing the recording"
  gts_satori.8.desc: "Zzz... Zzz... Shh...\n\n§HThat's enough, isn't it!\n\nDifferent types of planets, no matter how advanced the civilizations there, were all easily destroyed under the foot of the same giantess [REDACTED]... leaving nothing behind except for footprints and destruction…\n\nWhat hope and meaning is there to continue investigating, measuring and collecting more data!\n\nPerhaps…the moment the giantess that is holding us captive finds giantess [REDACTED], we will cease to exist, right?§!\n\nThis is what another crew member said in a hysterical tone. Prolonged exposure to a giantess at close range can very easily overwhelm one’s world view and mind."
  gts_satori.8.a: "Continue playing the last recording"
  gts_satori.9.desc: "Zzz... shh shh shh... Zzz...\n\n§HSe…ve…ral……m…onths …have…pass, at…the…be…ginn…ing…all…fine, every…one…seems…gra…du…al…ly…be…com…ing……str…ang……e…§!\n\nThe last recording is of very poor quality, and it is impossible to obtain useful information directly by listening to it. There is even a sense of terror. After our technical staff re-analyzed it, the recording has been reconstructed by AI and should maintain 99% of its original meaning.\n\n§HSeveral months have passed, at the beginning everything was fine, but everyone seems to be gradually becoming strange...\n\nThe giantess didn't harm anyone, but just asked us to do the same as how we did the first analysis of that Category VI stellar disaster, use our equipment to record any useful data from planets which she knows to have suffered the same disaster.\n\nMaybe this is just my unrealistic hope, but after this is over, the giantess should have no reason to continue detaining us, right?\n\nSo wouldn't it be right to just cooperate well with the giantess? Why did we secretly try to restart the hyperdrive? Why did we secretly take the ship's black box backup out? Why did we secretly record the system coordinates and sounds, and then drop the black box backup according to plan at the B power zone H airlock inspection port?\n\n...Eh, what I'm doing now, is it according to the plan or is it not according to plan?§!\n\n§RShe knows everything, she's watching everything, she understands everything...§!\n\nThe recording ends here."
  gts_satori.9.a: "...Hopefully that set of system coordinates is valuable enough"
  gts_satori.10.name: "Space Rift"
  gts_satori.10.desc: "Through the unremitting efforts of our outstanding scientists and engineers, we have successfully created a prototype device capable of capturing specific spatial anomalies within a star system. Although this device does not yet have the ability to anticipate the formation of spatial anomalies. One of our fleets equipped with the device accidentally discovered a space rift that was not completely closed in a certain star system.\n\nPerhaps this space rift is too small for a titan-sized giantess, therefore it was forgotten here.\n\nSo, two options lie in front of us: are we to stabilize the space rift on our side, research it, and make a long term plan, or immediately assemble a team of elites and go through the space rift to search for and rescue the missing research ship and crew?"
  gts_satori.10.a: "Study the space rift"
  gts_satori.10.b: "Send a team through the rift"
  gts_satori.11.name: "Studying the Rift"
  gts_satori.11.desc: "Batch after batch of scientists and engineers were once again assembled, and countless observation posts and power supply devices were built around the spatial rift in this star system. The observation posts are responsible for constructing equations for the structure of space, and the power supply devices are responsible for injecting disturbances into critical nodes, in order to influence and resist the tendency of the spatial rift to close and disappear naturally.\n\nTo give an analogy, space rifts are like wounds between two universes, they slowly heal if left alone, unless a stronger force continually agitates it to expand it. In just a few weeks, the power supply devices consumed more than a year's worth of residential electricity from a planet, in order to maintain the rift at several kilometers wide.\n\nDuring this time, our research has also made great strides because we have a place available for on-site observations. A world with a completely different set of spatial hierarchy structures and universal constants, and a world that is perfectly self-consistent, waves to our scientists from the other side. All sorts of observation instruments are aimed at the inside of the rift, just like the cannons of the nearby defense platforms and there is an earth-shattering new discovery almost every day.\n\nJust as the fleet commanders were also nervously preparing the search and rescue plan to go through the rift, a change that shocked us no less than the previous discovery of the Category VI stellar disaster took place."
  gts_satori.11.a: "Gravity wave anomaly detected!"
  gts_satori.12.name: "Passing Through the Gap"
  gts_satori.12.desc: "The space rift, which is too small for a giantess, is still several kilometers in size, enough for most of our ships to pass through. On the other side of the rift, is it another star system? Or a mirror universe? Our probe's power is insufficient to provide information to support either argument. \n\nAfter an urgent personnel dispatch and mobilization speech, an elite team capable of dealing with the worst known star system conditions, piloting the most advanced ships, slowly entered the rift under the watch of our world. Using special cable communication devices, through this team, we can also peek into the other world as if through a narrow eyepiece.\n\nAccording to the data sent back, our team landed on an unusually large planet in the other world. The gravimeter readings are normal, and the light is horizontal, coming from the dark side of the planet. Near the landing spot is an ominous red plain. Viewed down from the ship, the plain is densely covered with an unknown kind of tree, without branches or leaves, only the bare, equally ominous red trunks.\n\nJust as the team is about to land on the ground to establish an operating base that is absolutely hidden from the giantess, an extremely powerful impact suddenly attacked each of the team's ships from above without any warning."
  gts_satori.12.a: "Gravity wave anomaly detected?"
  gts_satori.13.name: "The Truth Revealed?"
  gts_satori.13.desc: "§R-Ara, did I happen to step on a few small bugs?-§!\n\nThe familiar yet terrifying words of the giantess indicate that we have run right into the barrel of her gun. After self-inspection, our ships are in the same condition as if they had lost power and crash-landed on the ground. The main damage to the hull comes from physical factors, and the crew members have also suffered various soft tissue injuries.\n\nBut she used the word 'step on', which means this must be…\n\n§R-Why did bugs crawl into my slippers? -§!"
  gts_satori.13.a: "This is... her slipper?"
  gts_satori.14.name: "The Truth Revealed!"
  gts_satori.14.desc: "Everything is now clear.\n\nThe dim light is due to the indoor environment, and the unknown red trees are nothing more than the fuzz on her red slippers.  One can see up close that they are made up of several strands of fibers, about a meter in diameter, that are twisted together.\n\nAnd right now, our ships are helplessly stuck between two plains, one red and one white. In this absurd situation, even if the ship's energy and weapon systems are essentially intact, no one would think that they could open fire and win against the giantess.\n\n§R-Oh ho ho, it seems that you little guys aren't stupid after all-§!\n\nAs every part of the hull emits creaking sounds, the terrifying and suffocating pressure further clamped down on our ships, which are unable to escape on their own. The giantess has completely treated the hundred-meter-long ship as some sort of beetle with a metal shell, as she twists her ankle and applies more and more pressure. Not to mention hundreds of millimeters of alloy, in the face of a titan-sized giantess, even the planet's crust is as fragile as foil.\n\nWithout any doubt, any titan-sized giantess has the ability to single handedly ravage a whole planet, and cause at least a Category V Stellar Disaster. In front of her any form of resistance can either be dealt with by raising a leg or by simply waving her arm. \n\n§R-Forget it, if I don't pay a visit to your nest, then this sort of thing will keep happening-§!"
  gts_satori.14.a: "Are we... done for?"
  gts_satori.15.desc: "Amidst the abnormal readings and buzzing alarms of countless monitoring devices, a delicate ten-kilometer-long finger of a girl extended from the space rift into our world. In front of such a finger, ordinary ships and defense platforms look as ridiculous as bugs and paper windows, with nothing left to do but to wait for this titan-sized giantess to issue her orders.\n\nBOOM BOOM BOOM!!!\n\nAs a giant finger is raised and lowered like a baton, the space rift rapidly extended upwards and downwards, as the overflowing, peerless energy overloaded all the power and observation devices that we had previously built around the rift. As a consequence, we could only witness with our very own eyes, in this deep, dark universe, how reality was split open lengthwise simply by the will of a single girl.\n\nIn less than a few seconds, the space rift, which was previously only a few kilometers long, has now reached hundreds of kilometers in length. Then slowly floated out of the rift, is a titan-sized giantess, whose name we don't know but is very familiar, who still has a pair of slippers on her feet, and who is almost 157 kilometers tall.\n\nShort, light purple hair, a sky-blue top, a pink dress, and not to mention the unusually conspicuous third eye that is floating on her chest. Everything about her, just like her size that can only be compared with that of a planet, cannot be measured by common sense, and is like a figment of fancy.\n\nSeen from afar, the giantess's appearance and figure exudes the air of a girl who has not yet entirely shed her childishness. But this is not a sign of weakness, but an eternal proof that cannot be washed away by time. An embodiment of the concepts of mass, power, and eternity all in one. Even if such a giantess were to appear in the midst of a brutal battlefield, any non-AI soldier would lose their will to fight on the spot. As for the fate that awaits them, it would naturally be decided arbitrarily by the giantess as if kneading clay.\n\n…Come to think of it, this invincible giantess has been glaring at us with her garnet-purple eyes ever since she came out of the rift."
  gts_satori.15.a: "…Can we reconcile?"
  gts_satori.15.b: "We've never had any malice"
