  gts_mari_anomaly: "Special Contact"
  gts_mari_anomaly_desc: "During a routine survey mission, your advance team noted the presence of a unique individual in the area. Her humanoid appearance and animal-like ears made her stand out, but what truly piqued interest was her enormous stature and a halo visible to the naked eye."
  gts_mari.2.name: "Special Contact"
  gts_mari.2.desc: "Information continues to filter in from the team, indicating that this unique individual possesses remarkable physiological resilience. She exhibits incredible strength and shows unusual resistance to lethal weapons. Our scientists have yet to comprehend the underlying principle, but perhaps we could recover this individual for further study."
  gts_mari.2.a: "Approve Close Observation"
  gts_mari.3.name: "Conflict"
  gts_mari.3.desc: "In your efforts to locate the individual, you discover that the local natives are attempting to hunt her down. Though she has done nothing out of line, her formidable size alone has made her a target in their eyes."
  gts_mari.3.a: "Observe and Wait"
  gts_mari.4.name: "Conflict"
  gts_mari.4.desc: "It's difficult to categorize this as a war. The unique individual clearly outmatches them in power, yet she refrains from retaliating against the attacks. As previous intel suggested, weapons leave minimal damage on her, pointing to an uncomprehended force shielding her...\n\nStrangely, she looks familiar in the intercepted video feed..."
  gts_mari.4.a: "Intervene Immediately!"
  gts_mari.5.name: "Conflict"
  gts_mari.5.desc: "Your team swiftly dismantled the conflict, recovering the individual with little trouble. Although she remained wary, she cooperated once communication was established."

  gts_mari.6.a: "Tell me about yourself"
  gts_mari.6.a.response: "Hmm... Thank you for your concern. Although it's still a bit unfamiliar for me, just being by your side brings comfort... Hehe, isn't this meeting predestined?"
  gts_mari.6.b: "About your size"
  gts_mari.6.b.response: "Indeed, I was startled. Everyone seems so tiny... Eh? Is it me who's too big? Ahaha, it didn't sink in right away. Have you eaten? Would you like to join me?"
  gts_mari.6.c: "About Kivotos"
  gts_mari.6.c.response: "Speaking of which, I wonder how everyone is doing now. Perhaps everyone at Holy Trinity is worried? So... let's get closer? Let's pray together for everyone in Kivotos and for your future... Ah!! Please, please, don't mind that last part!!!"
  gts_mari.6.d: "About war"
  gts_mari.6.d.response: "If possible, I'd really like to avoid it, but Mary understands this world isn't as pleasant as Kivotos... It's okay, if necessary, I will offer my strength for you."

  # Daily Events
  gts_mari.100.name: "A Workout Incident"
  gts_mari.100.desc: "The arrival of the nun is no longer a special event for the populace. However, protecting her privacy remains an unresolved issue. This morning, while Mary was exercising, she inadvertently left the door ajar, allowing a few peepers to sneak inside. One even climbed onto her sole during her stretches, seemingly engaging in inappropriate behavior."
  gts_mari.100.a: "Handle this seriously, find those culprits"
  gts_mari.100.b: "No need to worry, let Mary handle it herself"
  gts_mari.100.c: "Maybe I could sneak a peek next time?"
  gts_mari.110.name: "A Workout Incident"
  gts_mari.110.desc: "Though Mary pleads for the perpetrators, to prevent similar incidents, harsh penalties must be imposed on these mischief-makers!"
  gts_mari.110.a: "Make them reflect well!"
  gts_mari.120.name: "A Workout Incident"
  gts_mari.120.desc: "It turns out the worry was unnecessary. Even though her size is now sufficient to squish adult men like insects, she did nothing to the voyeurs who insulted her. In fact, Mary seemed momentarily alarmed by the peculiar sensation beneath her foot and only realized it was a man crawling under her sole after instinctively shaking him off.\n\n'Eh... Are you not hurt? Sorry, I didn’t know it was...'\n\nBlushing, the girl's words were shared with everyone via the surveillance equipment, unsurprisingly earning her adoration and affection. Honestly, even you couldn't help but develop a fondness and an unnecessary attachment for this nun."
  gts_mari.120.a: "What a pity"
  gts_mari.130.name: "A Workout Incident"
  gts_mari.130.desc: "When you get close to her, you understand why those voyeurs would risk being squished to approach her. Unlike interacting through devices, the intuitive sense of power demonstrates itself in a cute and graceful manner. Mary noticed you first, approaching with a gentle smile. Her presence instantly wipes away your previous discomfort, nurturing another subtle emotion.\n\n'Eh? Is something wrong?'"
  gts_mari.130.a: "‘I...’"
  gts_mari.131.name: "A Date...?"
  gts_mari.131.desc: "Seeing your suggestion, she shows a bit of unease, with her usually perky ears stiffening unnaturally, but when you suggest dropping it, she quickly grabs you, unwilling to release you. Only after realizing her gaffe did she emit a cute cry of distress and set you back down.\n\n'Then tomorrow...?' \n\nMary averts her face, her reddened ears revealing her buried thoughts. Noticing you hadn't replied promptly, she cautiously peeked at you again, seemingly expectant."
  gts_mari.131.a: "No way"
  gts_mari.132.name: "A Date...?"
  gts_mari.132.desc: "Listening to your words, she seems spaced out, her mouth ajar in disbelief, scanning your expressions for signs of jest. However, seeing your softened face, she swallows her words, replacing them with endearing reproach.\n'Today, not tomorrow.'\nResponding to your prank, she plucks you up again, abruptly cutting all other senses around you.\n'Hmph... As a punishment for your mischief, remain silent until the ritual is over.'\nYou didn't need to tell Mary that despite everything, you could still hear her excited and rhythmic heart flutters.\n...... Arriving at a place perfectly suited for Mary's size, watching her tread through the grass and occasionally glance at you, you feel a relaxation you haven't felt in a while, mingled with slight drowsiness.\n‘...?’\nSnapping back, you feel the accustomed swaying halted, and beneath you, where Mary's palm cushioned you, now replaced by the earthy solidity. Before you can seek Mary, a force presses you to the ground, impossible to resist.\n‘Hehe, this is a small punishment for dozing off during our date, Teacher?’\nHer words swiftly ease your vigilance. Mary slowly lifted her finger, revealing the bright sky and her captivating smile consuming most of your field of view.\n‘Shh... Close your eyes? What happens next, can we keep it a secret?’\nBefore you could react, she lifts you from the grass, ignoring any dirt clinging to you. Her gentle kiss replaced any sense of the external world..."
  gts_mari.132.a: "Congratulations"
  gts_mari.200.name: "Research Bottleneck"
  gts_mari.200.desc: "Study on the mysterious force has plateaued. Despite Mary’s cooperation with the research and experiments, the incomprehensible force eludes control. Current data suggests that the 'mystery' offers more than just protection against lethal attacks."
  gts_mari.200.a: "Apply some stimulation"
  gts_mari.200.b: "Slow the research pace, prioritize Mary's safety!"
  gts_mari.210.name: "Research Bottleneck"
  gts_mari.210.desc: "Following a stimulation experiment, Mary exhibited certain emotional fluctuations, with physiological indicators soaring to several times above normal baseline level. Despite halting the experiment, a severe incident occurred... Mary’s body enlarged to a terrifying extent while unconscious.\n\nMeasures were taken immediately, but the accident inflicted serious casualties around the laboratory. Her rapidly growing body effortlessly collapsed the lab walls, becoming an efficient tool of destruction against all it encountered. The areas in direct contact with her body turned into chaos. Lamentably, the girl responsible continued dazed.\n\nNearby residents noticed the tremor's source... In fact, under her sock-covered feet, ignoring her is a luxury you can no longer afford."
  gts_mari.210.a: "Pray..."
  gts_mari.220.name: "Research Bottleneck"
  gts_mari.220.desc: "Research inherently follows certain objective laws. With current technology unable to unveil the mystery surrounding Mary, patience might offer another solution. After all, the miracles surrounding her are enough to defy common sense in this universe... but, is Mary getting larger?"
  gts_mari.220.a: "To know what happens next, wait for the story to unfold"
