  site_firefly_potral: "§BFirefly Rendezvous"
  site_firefly_potral.desc: "A strange biological signal has been detected. We can send scientists to investigate."
  gts_firefly_potral.02.name: "A Planet Riddled with Holes"
  gts_firefly_potral.02.desc: "An intermittent, strange signal has led our scientists to this system. On the largest lava planet in the system, we've discovered traces of life.\n A biological slime covers most of the planet's landmass. Through global scans, we've found numerous underground caverns of varying sizes, clustered together.\n All signs indicate that some civilization once existed here, but we haven't found any structures on the surface. Perhaps a more thorough investigation of the planet is needed to uncover the truth."
  gts_firefly_potral.02a: "Fund the construction of a scientific research station."
  gts_firefly_potral.02b: "Dispatch the scientific advance team."
  gts_firefly_potral.03.name: "A Sweet Gift"
  gts_firefly_potral.03.desc: "We collected some of the biological material for investigation and discovered it's rich in nutrients, capable of rapidly repairing biological damage, and even transmitting bioelectrical signals.\n One of our researchers boldly tasted the substance and found it to have a rich, sweet taste like honey.  Her days of research fatigue vanished, and her work efficiency skyrocketed, after which she remained in a state of excitement.\n We had to restrain her and strictly control the substance. It's unclear whether there will be other effects on those who consume it, and further observation is needed. However, we've begun refining and concentrating the substance. It could potentially be used as a food additive to improve the researchers' daily diet."
  gts_firefly_potral.03a: "Proceed with caution. I have a bad feeling about this."
  gts_firefly_potral.03b: "That's amazing! Let me have a taste too."
  gts_firefly_potral.04.name: "Sudden Attack"
  gts_firefly_potral.04.desc: "This morning, we lost contact with the research personnel on the planet. Before losing contact, they sent out a distress signal. Upon receiving the message, we immediately dispatched ground troops to the surface to provide support.\n The entire research station was in chaos. Research materials and data were scattered everywhere.  The heavy alloy isolation door was torn open, and there were large amounts of sprayed blood on the walls and floor, but we didn't find any bodies. It seems they were taken by the attackers.\n The scene looks like it was under external attack, but strangely, the research station's active defense system didn't activate.  While we were still collecting clues, the sensors issued an alert. A large number of life signs emerged from the ground and surrounded us.\n We quickly understood the reason for the anomaly. Among the creatures that attacked the research station were many of our previous researchers, those who had tasted the new 'honey.' But now, they were mindlessly lunging at us, and we had no choice but to return fire."
  gts_firefly_potral.04a: "Don't panic! Regroup and prepare to counterattack."
  gts_firefly_potral.04b: "This place is too dangerous. We should break through as soon as possible."
  gts_firefly_potral.05.name: "Mysterious Rescue"
  gts_firefly_potral.05.desc: "Just as the marines were fighting a bloody battle, a strange voice suddenly came over the comms channel: 'It seems you're having some trouble.' As we traced the source of the signal, the voice continued: 'Don't worry, I'm here to help. You've encountered a swarm attack. I'll attack from the outside. You just need to clear out the bugs that have slipped into the building and then hide inside.'\n As soon as the voice finished, the research station began to shake. This level of tremor must have been caused by continental plate movement.  The detection systems of the ships in near-Earth orbit also suddenly malfunctioned, unable to capture information from the surface. We could only vaguely see a giant creature moving towards the research station from the portholes.  Soon, a cloud of dust and fog arose. When it dispersed, the sensors returned to normal, and we didn't detect the giant creature's signal, but the trail it left behind was clearly visible on the surface.\n It was a crescent-shaped trench centered on the research station, at least several kilometers deep, making it appear as if the research station had been built on a cliff. Countless insect corpses piled up at the bottom of the valley, leaving only a few remaining Zerg. At this moment, a machine was cleaning up these stragglers. When our marines exited the research station, it had just finished eliminating the last bug.\n It was a bipedal mech, and quite aesthetically pleasing to our race. It walked towards us, and now we could clearly hear its voice from its mask: 'Threat neutralized, exiting alert mode.' It was an emotionless, mechanical voice. 'It's been a long time since anyone came to this planet. Now, can you tell me your purpose?'"
  gts_firefly_potral.05a: "We had to spend some time explaining the whole story."
  gts_firefly_potral.06.name: "The Planet's Secret"
  gts_firefly_potral.06.desc: "After listening to our story and answering a few of its questions, it took some time to understand the current situation. 'So the Glamour Empire is long gone. That final battle didn't save anything in the end?' it muttered to itself. We couldn't guess its mood through the mask.  After a long while, it said to us: 'In that case, come with me. I will answer your questions.'  It led us to open a hidden door leading underground, and on the way down, explained the whole story.\n This place was once the frontline of the Glamour Empire's fight against the universal locust plague. Countless Glamour Iron Riders loyal to the Empress fought against the swarm here, and it was one of them.  Later, in the final battle on this planet, they wiped out the swarm's broodmother at the cost of almost all of the Glamour Iron Riders. As the only survivor on the planet's surface, it lost communication capabilities, was left on this planet, and fell into a long slumber until our arrival awakened it.\n After descending the stairs to the bottom of the facility, we saw a huge incubation tank. 'As for the person who just rescued you...' It walked to a console, entered a few commands, and the walls of the incubation tank gradually became transparent, allowing us to see the full picture.  Inside was a sleeping girl, dressed in a cyan robe, the decorations on her head and the cicada-wing-like ribbons behind her seemingly showcasing her fragility.\n It turned around, and she opened her eyes. 'Now, it's time for introductions. I am Glamour Iron Rider, serial number AR-26710. You can call me Sam, or you can call me Liúyíng (Firefly).' The voice seemed to come from the mech, perhaps from the girl, or perhaps from the depths of the earth. 'Can I join you?'"

  gts_firefly_potral.06a: "Welcome to join us, Liúyíng."

You can consult me on any military matters, and I will offer advice based on my past combat experience. Of course, I will also participate directly in battles, fighting on the front lines of expansion."

Of course, every knight is cultivated from an incubation pod, born with the mindset of absolute loyalty to Her Majesty the Empress imprinted on them. However, I can't feel that imprint anymore. Perhaps Her Majesty truly is..."
  gts_firefly.999.b: "About the trench near the research station"
  gts_firefly.999.b.response: "Well, actually, what you see before you isn't my true form. For the needs of war, our bodies were designed to absorb energy from the corpses of Zerg and comrades. In that final battle, there were too many dead Zerg and fallen comrades. Coupled with the unique psionic structure of the broodmother, something strange happened to me during absorption. As I absorbed energy, my body grew larger and larger, to the point where my true form can only hide underground, and I usually move around using this separated body."
  gts_firefly.999.c: "Then this separated body of yours..."
  gts_firefly.999.c.response: "This separated body is an ability I developed based on my body's characteristics. The energy within my body can be transformed into a liquid state and separated from the main body. Then, I can also transform this liquid energy into a solid form, while synchronizing consciousness through the Firefly Network to achieve the purpose of separation. However, the more I separate, the weaker and smaller my main body becomes."
  gts_firefly.999.d: "What's the deal with the remaining Zerg on the planet?"
  gts_firefly.999.d.response: "These were generated from uncontrolled energy I inadvertently leaked. They may have subconsciously taken the form of the Zerg I hate the most. I can't seem to completely eliminate them, so I'll have to trouble you with this in the future."
  gts_firefly.999.e: "And this creep..."
  gts_firefly.999.e.response: "Most of this planet has been combined with my energy, so this creep is actually a biological substance secreted from my body. To put it simply, it's... (Liúyíng suddenly blushes) ...something like love fluids. Alright, stop asking such questions."
