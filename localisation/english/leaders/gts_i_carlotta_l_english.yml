 # Original: “轰——！”伴随着震耳欲聋的爆炸声，珂莱塔那纤细而优雅的高跟靴轻轻踩下，璀璨的星球瞬间崩碎，火焰与碎片如烟火般在虚空中炸裂开来。她的动作毫无迟疑，甚至带着几分漫不经心的优雅。她低头注视着靴底，纤长的睫毛微微颤动，仿佛对脚下的残骸多了一丝不耐。“太容易了，就像踩碎一颗糖果。”她抬起靴子，用指尖掸了掸靴底，确认没有任何碎屑残留后，才满意地将靴子收回。漂泊者的呼吸顿时变得急促，他站在珂莱塔的肩膀上，双拳紧握，声音中满是愤怒与悲痛。“珂莱塔！它们……它们也有生命啊！”珂莱塔微微侧头，目光落在漂泊者身上，唇角带着一抹若有似无的笑意。她的笑容是那样冰冷，仿佛完全无法理解漂泊者的激动。“那又如何？”她的声音依旧清冷，却带着一丝不容置疑的坚定，“我只关心你。”她的目光重新回到脚下的残骸上，语气变得更加漠然，“而它们？不过是碍眼的存在罢了。”漂泊者愣住了，他看着珂莱塔那张冷若冰霜的脸庞，心中的怒火几乎要将他燃尽。“你到底把其他生命当成什么了？”他不满地反问道。无关紧要的东西而已。”珂莱塔淡淡地回应，似乎根本没把漂泊者的愤怒放在心上。
 gts_carlotta.11.desc:0 "“Boom—!” Accompanied by a deafening explosion, Kal'tsit's slender and elegant high-heeled boot stepped down gently. The bright planet instantly shattered, flames and fragments exploding in the void like fireworks. Her movement was unhesitating, even with a bit of nonchalant elegance. She looked down at the sole of her boot, her long eyelashes trembling slightly, as if feeling a trace of impatience towards the debris under her feet. “Too easy, like crushing a candy.” She lifted her boot and dusted off the sole with her fingertips. Only after confirming no debris remained did she withdraw her boot with satisfaction. The drifter's breathing suddenly became rapid. Standing on Kal'tsit's shoulder, his fists clenched, his voice full of anger and grief. “Kal'tsit! They... they also had lives!” Kal'tsit turned her head slightly, her gaze falling on the drifter, a faint smile playing on her lips. Her smile was so cold, as if she couldn't understand the drifter's excitement at all. “So what?” Her voice remained cold, but with an unquestionable firmness, “I only care about you.” Her gaze returned to the debris under her feet, her tone becoming more indifferent, “And them? Just eyesores.” The drifter froze, looking at Kal'tsit's frosty face, the anger in his heart almost burned him out. “What on earth do you consider other lives to be?” he asked back in dissatisfaction. “Insignificant things.” Kal'tsit responded faintly, seemingly not taking the drifter's anger to heart."

 gts_carlotta.102.desc:0 "The exploration team has arrived in the system, and found a peculiar crystalline planet, with an outer shell composed of special crystal that wraps the planet, but it's not a complete shell, but rather composed of countless geometric crystal blocks forming a geometric beauty, in the crystal gaps can faintly see the planet's surface environment, the interior is mostly composed of oceans but also land, even traces of civilization can be observed, but oddly, no matter what detection methods are used, no life signs can be observed, not even microorganisms, as if life has never existed. The exploration team was puzzled by this and decided to prepare to pass through the crystal gaps to enter the planet's interior for investigation. Suddenly, the entire surface of the planet shimmered with light. Under closer observation, the research team found that those 'crystals' were actually countless space stations... or rather 'coffins'?

At this moment, a cold but unmistakably female voice came from all communication channels.\n“I hate being disturbed”\nThen, dazzling light lit up on the planet's surface, and thousands of light spears shot out from the planet, instantly destroying the shields and armor of the research ship.

 # Original: 珂莱塔低头，目光落在手心的漂泊者身上。他蜷缩着身子，渺小得如同一只易碎的瓷娃娃。她突发奇想，缓缓将他举到嘴边，红唇微启，轻轻地含住了他。“喂喂，你干什么？！”漂泊者意外地惊叫，试图挣脱她的口腔，却完全无法抗衡珂莱塔的力量。珂莱塔轻笑了一声，吐出漂泊者，动作优雅得如同吐掉一粒微尘。“只是想看看你会不会更小一点。”她语气轻柔，甚至带着几分玩味。漂泊者气喘吁吁地站稳，眼中满是无奈。他指着珂莱塔，声音中带着些许颤抖：“......觉得这样很有趣吗？”珂莱塔对他笑了笑并没有回答，只是抬手掸了掸她的长袍，目光重新落在那些悬浮的星球上。她的神情瞬间转为冷漠，每当毁灭一个星球，她总要仔细检查自己的手套和靴子，确保没有一丝污秽留在她的身上。“这些星球的存在简直污染了我。”她露出嫌弃的表情，将一颗燃烧的星球随手丢向无尽的虚空。“真希望这些垃圾别碰到我。”她的目光再次转回漂泊者，冰冷的眼神中竟瞬间多了几分柔和与深情。她微微一笑，眼底涌动着复杂的情感。“至于你，乖乖留在我身边吧，这样才不会碍眼～”她伸出手指，轻轻触碰着漂泊者，仿佛在抚摸一件珍贵的艺术品。漂泊者看着珂莱塔，眼中充满矛盾。他想挣脱，却无法逃离；想反抗，却无法战胜。于是，他只能在她掌心中沉默着，等待命运的下一步。
