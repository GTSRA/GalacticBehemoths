  gts_paopao.1.name: "She Wants to Come Home With Me!"
  gts_paopao.1.desc: "The young girl's lithe figure is dazzling even in the vast emptiness of space, even as she curiously uses those brilliant vertical pupils to gaze at the gas giant, following behind the Empire's science vessel.\n§P“There seems to be something there!'§!\nWords cannot be transmitted in a vacuum, and naturally, Yaorong's words cannot reach the science vessel – especially since the scientist piloting the vessel is quite nervous. The princess of their own house seems to have no idea how terrifying her sky-covering body is, and even the pressure of just standing there is beyond the reach of ordinary people.\nYaorong made a slight offset with the science ship, and in a few steps, she came to the back of this gas giant. And in this place that has not been detected by the science ship, a... rather beautiful little bug is nestled?\nFor Yaorong, not to mention a newly born space amoeba, even the plane nightmares nestled in the black hole can only be considered a small fry. Upon seeing the single little one, Yaorong's girlish heart also fluttered, for the little one before her could now be held in her hand, the second biggest creature that meets her aesthetic!\nThe little dragon reached out, gently picking up the larva, soothing the stranded fish with as much tenderness as possible. And the amoeba seemed to sense Yaorong's feelings, snuggling against her palm with her wide head as if to please her.\nAnd this action...\n§P“Daddy! She wants to come home with me!'§!"

  gts_paopao.2.name: "Allegiance"
  gts_paopao.2.desc: "Yaorong named the 'little amoeba' Bubble, and the very few who worshiped Leviathan creatures called her the Goddess of the Night.\nLittle Bubble grew quickly, although still inferior to the growth rate of your children, compared to her kind... this amoeba, who was often hugged and rubbed by Yaorong's head and breasts, seemed to be growing well. And, as if because the two little ones often stuck together to play, the amoeba called Bubble has already taken on some of Yaorong's characteristics – at least the Empire has never seen a space amoeba that could transform into a human.\n§P“Daddy-'§!\n§g“……'§!\nThe sky-covering young girl descended from the sky, and under her armpit was a much smaller... little loli? Anyway, her sister, your other daughter, would never want to be pinned under her elder sister’s armpit.\n§P“Look, Bubble can also transform!'§!\nYaorong seemed very happy, but every time she was so happy, she would become silly. For example, she hadn't had time to put the little girl under her arm down, and she also forgot that her height of tens of thousands of meters only allowed her father to see her heel.\n§Y“Put her down.'§!\nAlthough her vision is filled with her child's black high heels and the shadows she casts, you are already used to it – at least this girl didn't yell and stomp down from the sky, crushing a city with millions of people or flattening an industrial park with a single foot.\nThis is already a great improvement, right?\n§P“Uh-huh! Bubble, this is my daddy, and also your... um... Daddy, what should she call you?'§!\nThe little dragon cub put down the Bubble, which was thousands of meters tall, while continuing to mutter. And the amoeba miss, being a space creature, obviously hadn't adjusted to her 'master’s' mindset. After all, in those past years, besides learning the art of transformation with this master and her equally large sister, she hadn't done anything else.\n§g“Master.'§!\nAfter landing safely, the amoeba girl didn't greet you immediately, but turned and gave a great salute to your dragon cub. Her voice was very soft, but her pronunciation wasn't very clear... but this was normal. This girl had finally managed to transform into a human shape, and before she had time to learn to speak she was put into a maid outfit by her master, and then, like a dog with a good find, was brought to this small planet under the armpit of her master.\nBubble naturally had some feelings, and so did you. Originally, only your daughter’s black high heels occupied your entire vision, but now there was a skirt you had never seen before, gently swaying less than a hundred meters above you... If it were just the skirt like a silk curtain gently swaying, that would be fine, but that skirt could crush the Empire’s army vehicles if it landed!\n§P“Bubble! Be careful not to step on my dad!'§!\nDespite your little princess shouting excitedly, without any sign of lady-like behavior, the already bowing Bubble did not move her body. After all, even the most indifferent creature could, after more than a year together, know what kind of personality her “master' had-she was a father-con to the point of being irrational and so powerful she could not be resisted……girl.\n§g“Yes, master.'§!\nAfter receiving permission from Yaorong, Bubble finally stood up - compared to her daughter’s always proud and out-of-proportion body, this space amoeba miss is just barely up to Yaorong’s knees, but even Yaorong’s knees are several thousand meters high! A giantess several thousand meters tall turning from a kneeling to a standing position in front of you…\nYou were numb to it.\nBut thankfully, this newborn girl didn't cause you any harm, and after confirming that you were the father that Yaorong had been thinking of, Bubble hid very timidly behind Yaorong’s calf. It was obvious that the girl was very afraid of you, and you don't know what Yaorong told this little one about you. \n§P“Bubble, you can't be so rude... don't be afraid, daddy, no matter how powerful he is, he's just that small-hey, daddy, don't look at me like that, I was just coaxing a child!'§!\nYour numbness went further, and you didn't even dare imagine how those guys in the Empire's capital would discuss your little silly dragon cub.\nFinally, after much persuasion, Yaorong finally semi-forcibly calmed Bubble down, and let the little one, who was somewhat dizzy, greet you and swear allegiance to you-you were just more and more curious about what your little dragon had told Bubble, that can make a little girl more than a thousand meters high so afraid of you, a little person not even as tall as her toe... but seeing the footprints and shoe prints left by the two girls for greeting you, you very decisively withdrew your thoughts - it's better to be a little afraid, so that these big girls don't get playful one day and smash you or the Imperial capital.\n"
  gts_paopao.2.a: "Okay."
  gts_paopao.3.title: "Cleaning?"
  gts_paopao.3.desc: "§P“Bubble-you're too slow!'§!\n\nThe little dragon increasingly enjoys playing on planets. Although you’ve warned her more than once about the impact of her immense body, the biggest damage this girl had done to the Empire’s homeworld was sneaking over to the agricultural sectors, drinking a few factories’ worth of alcohol, and falling asleep-while it didn’t cause much damage, her poor sleeping posture left you with a lasting impression.\n\nSpeaking of which, the little dragon is currently sprawled out like a dried salted fish on the surface of the sea, boredly looking at Bubble who’s arriving late-a dragon stretching out her body to cover the sun has the bizarre competitive spirit of a child, and even with the little one she picked up herself, she had to compare herself…even if it was just something like who can arrive at the Empire's homeworld first.\n\nThe black dress she was wearing was already carelessly tossed on a 'small island', and the young girl's fair, beautiful body, which was impossible to look away from, was open for all to see-although, besides you, who was forcibly pulled over and left on a deserted island, only Bubble is able to actually see this beautiful body of Yaorong’s. \n\n§P“Oh, father, you're here too~'§!\n\nYaorong feigned a look as if she'd only just noticed you, and a pitiful expression appeared on her face, which was beautiful to the point of sorcery. Or rather, your little dragon cub was putting on an act to make you feel sorry for her, while muttering things like, “Why do you have to work when the weather is this nice?', “Only dummies wouldn’t come play with their daughter' and the like.\n\n§P“Do you…want to come play with me~? Bubble will take a while longer to arrive anyway.'§!\n\nThe little girl said with a smile, but she deliberately stretched her mouth towards you, it's uncertain if she intended for you to closely examine the blood-red world you once explored, or if Yaorong wanted to display her power in front of you... after all, this little dragon cub is currently 'floating' on the surface of the sea at 100,000 times its size. If she were to stand up, she could reach from the deepest trench to the highest peak of the Empire's homeworld.\n\nAlthough you don't know yet, the top of the Empire's homeworld has been replaced by your own child’s tall boots. The girl even intentionally left her boots and stockings on the side of the 'holy mountain' in the Empire’s capital, and the fact that the highest peak of the holy mountain was not even as tall as the sole of the girl's boot gave her a sense of indescribable depravity and superiority.\n\nHowever, she didn’t dare show any of it to you.\n\n§P“Father~ What are you thinking about~'§!\n\nThe burning hot breath in the young girl’s mouth washed over your body like a flood. If it weren’t for the small hill behind you, you might have flown away with the trees around you, that had grown for decades or even hundreds of years.\n\n§P“Oops, I forgot that you’re this small, father, I'll be more careful next time- don't come over with that frustrated face! Yaorong’s movements might blow you away!'§!\n\nThe little girl intentionally raised her mouth to speak, but even so, Yaorong felt a little guilty looking at your soaking wet and flushed appearance. Even if you're just the size of a small bug in front of Yaorong now, you’re still the strongest one that the little girl loves most.\n\n§Y“Yaorong.'§!\n\nYour voice was full of helplessness, in addition to a hint of anger.\n\n§P“I'll listen to daddy... I really will...'§!\n\nThe little one didn’t dare reply, lowering her head, letting her thick, long tail sway with her lazy lying position, lying down in front of you like a docile puppy. That's right, your daughter, your good girl, is still very much like a little dog in some ways.\n\nIt's just that, with the dragon horns on her head, it’s a little dog that is nearly 200,000 meters tall.\n\n§P“I really will... Hey dad, where's my Bubble?'§!\n\n……\n\nThe Empire’s holy mountain had been overtaken by an even more towering 'mountain', and the shadow cast from that 'mountain', which also symbolized divinity, even engulfed several cities built around the holy mountain. The holy mountain, hailed as the abode of the gods, which has been described countless times in poems and chants with extremely extravagant wording, its towering summit is not even as tall as the girl's discarded long boots.\n\nBubble is currently sitting at the opening of the boot, and the place where Yaorong could reach her leg inside with just a few movements of her fingers is as big as a balcony for Bubble, who is now nearly a thousand meters tall- the young girl is now staring blankly at the marks that her master left on the continent.\n\nLarge areas of grey stick to the ground like germs-according to the master, these are the cities of those small guys, and also what she sees as... moss? Bubble doesn't understand why the homes of those small creatures are called moss by the master, nor can she understand why the master always steps on these 'mosses' with a wicked smile on her face during landing operations.\n\nBubble thinks it’s dirty, but she doesn’t dare to refute her master. She still remembers when she asked Yaorong questions that made her feel embarrassed, her entire body (her entire worm form) was held in her master’s mouth… although her master’s mouth was warm and allowed her to absorb the nutrients for transformation and evolution. But being held as a piece of candy in her master’s mouth is still too strange.\n\n§g“The master said to clean... clean... It can’t be cleaning the cities led by the leader, right?'§!\n\nBubble muttered to herself, but her eyes were looking far away-city clusters, capable of holding tens of millions of people, standing proudly there, and the high-rise buildings reflected the tenacity and growth of civilization. But for Bubble, if it wasn't for her master’s footprints purposely avoiding the gray moss, this world would be completely different. After all, every imprint that Yaorong left behind is enough to hold more than one so-called magnificent city district, and apart from the mountains that are up to a thousand meters tall, the remaining 'small hills' on her path were reduced to the point where they clung to Yaorong's feet, like dust.\n\nBubble hugged her tail and pondered for a while longer, then made a very important decision, she chose to clean the master’s boots.\n\nBubble had seen the cruel and violent side of her master. She would crush an entire planet with billions or even tens of billions of people between her toes, letting the magma from the core of the planet flow between her toes; or, for a more sensual approach, she'd knead the surface of the planet with her toes before viciously killing all the life on it. After that, she'd feed the planet, completely covered in her pheromones, to her own sister-in short, every time Yaorong chooses to use her feet to punish a planet, she'd always stuffed her dirty feet right back inside, and the black silk, originally for satisfying the leader's special fetish, was always, intentionally left by the master, on the side of the governor’s mansion on her homeworld.\n\nIn short, to put it simply, although your little dragon cub is considered a clean girl, the task of destroying a planet always ends with a… bit of dirt. Although the little girl had already cleaned herself by soaking in the sea, her boots could not soak themselves in the sea.\n\n§g“Ummm…'§!\n\nBubble liked the smell of Yaorong, or rather, she liked everything about her master. From the saliva she could barely grasp between Yaorong’s lips to the starship or planetary debris crushed between Yaorong’s toes... everything was a blessing for Bubble.\n\nEven if she's inside Yaorong’s somewhat smelly boots now, even if she feels as if she's cleaning an environment that humans would see as a dead planet, even if… the owner of those boots is running around like a puppy, trying to find her father.\n\nBubble originally planned to start cleaning directly, but after thinking for a while, she decided to observe her current environment first– she said that “sharpening the axe doesn’t delay the woodcutter' but it’s likely only she knows what she’s truly thinking.\n\nYaorong’s footprints on the planet are enough to change the ecological environment, and that power is clearly shown in the form of a footprint in the insole of the shoe. To better appreciate her master’s power, Bubble specifically compressed her body again, using a hundred times her own size to thoroughly explore the most explicit toe print at the front of the boot.\n\nThe faint, sweat-scented black print was extremely wide, and even if Bubble was originally nearly a thousand meters tall, she wouldn’t be able to fill the mark made by Yaorong’s big toe - to be more precise, even if Bubble's original body was throwing herself around, rolling on the print, she would have to roll for a long time.\n\n§g“Huh?'§!\n\nOf course, Bubble wouldn’t run around in the footprints left in her master's boot like a puppy. She was just surprised that there could even be creatures capable of existing in a harsh environment like that of her master’s boots. When she saw tiny, bacteria-like creatures, almost capable of building a city, fitting into Yaorong’s toe print, she suddenly remembered what her master had told her before.\n\nA civilization called “Boot Dwellers', a civilization whose homeworld was nearly stepped into the core of its planet by a pair of boots. They evolved and prospered from the girl’s boots, and in an era where they developed FTL engines and the ability to travel between star systems they still prefer to be nestled in those boots… or rather, the damp, dark environment of the boots.\n\nBubble didn’t quite understand it at the time, but now that she saw a civilization similar to 'Boot Dwellers' born in her own master's boots, she understood why those creatures were so attached to such an environment-the smell and byproducts of the master's normal physiological processes were enough for those creatures to see as a natural environment, even a miracle. Even if they could continue to exist without being killed by Yaorong’s toe moving, they wouldn’t want to escape that environment.\n\nOf course, within less than half an hour, Bubble quickly adjusted and became infatuated with the environment. What she has to think about now is whether to clean up this civilization that was born in the master’s boots.\n\n§P“Daddy-Hey, I didn't step on these cities! Really! Hey? A mountain? Where did that mountain come from… Yaorong doesn’t know…'§!\n\nBubble, inside of Yaorong’s boots, also heard the silly voice of her master, and in the past, after hearing Yaorong’s words, she’d generally be very happy and try to jump on Yaorong, but now… Bubble raised her head, thinking about when her master was going to set down her foot.\n\nAs for whether she needed to protect the city that might become a Boot Dweller's civilization wasn’t something Bubble needed to consider now. Bubble only needed to wait until Yaorong put down her feet and realized she was there, and then explain the situation to her, leaving the master to decide.\n\n§P“Ugh, what does it mean to not throw your socks beside your governor’s mansion? Don’t you think mine are… Don't squeeze Yaorong's neck, it doesn't feels anything, daddy!'§!\n\nBubble always knew that the Empire’s leader and her master had a very good relationship, to the point where it didn’t seem like a father-daughter one. But Bubble doesn’t intend or want to think about their relationship-it’s her master, after all, and if she wanted to, she could crush a planet with one hand! She wouldn’t want to be bothered by discussing a topic that her master wouldn’t like.\n\n§P“Aiya, daddy, can’t you look at my good points? You clearly saw that and were quite happy about it… oh, you didn’t see? Then do you want me to go…'§!\n\nYaorong's teasing voice, along with her black silk foot, filled Bubble's senses. The black that once covered the sky and sun was her master's freely raised wings, the despair brought by what was called the wings of death, but now, her slowly falling silk feet can bring Bubble the same feeling.\n\n§P“Huh?'§!\n\n§Y“What is it, Yaorong?'§!\n\nThe little one didn’t answer you, but instead, showed a slightly confused expression.\n\n§P“Ummm… I think I know where Bubble has gone...'§!\n\nYaorong looked rather strange right now since the little one had just changed into her usual formal dress, but wrapped her lower body with those extremely alluring black silk–however, the girl hadn’t put on her boots yet, and one of her feet was on the front of the Empire's governor’s mansion. \n\nYaorong sighed and took out her foot, which was almost inside her boot, looking at her boot, or rather the little one inside her boot with a hint of dissatisfaction.\n\n§g“Greetings, master.'§!\n\n§P“Huuu… Bubble, the cleaning I was talking about was of the body, what are you doing?'§!\n\nYaorong’s voice sounded helpless, but the expression she was showing was a gentle, smiling one - seeing Bubble carefully fly out of her boot and into her palm, like a small butterfly, how could Yaorong blame her? She was the little one she raised.\n\n§g“Master, I was cleaning your boots for you.'§!\n\n§P“Hmm?'§!\n\n§g“There's the beginning of a civilization inside.'§!\n\nYaorong’s proud expression vanished, replaced with a blushing face-logically a being that would crush a planet between her toes, or by her mood, shouldn’t show a shy expression, since for them, there would only be two options: raise or stomp them.§!\n\nBut this brutal premise wouldn’t occur when you were around, as long as you’re by Yaorong’s side, she would always show her soft, childlike and daughterly side.§!\n\n§P“Daddy-Bubble just didn’t say anything!'§!\n\nYaorong’s hand suddenly closed, making the little one inside the hand let out a garbled mumble.§!\n\n§P“You, heard, no, thing!'§!\n\nYour little one was in such a hurry that she was almost prepared to wipe out the entire homeworld, and if she didn’t control her stomping force… the effects wouldn’t be that much less.§!\n\n§P“Right, daddy…'§!"
