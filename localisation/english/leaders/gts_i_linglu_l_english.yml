  gts_extension_anomaly_leader_linglu_desc: "While scanning this habitable planet, we discovered a 161-kilometer-tall giantess lying on the grasslands. She even seemed to wave at our research vessel?"
  gts_linglu.1.title: "Communication Established"
  gts_linglu.1.desc: "We easily established communication with the equipment on this giantess. She now indicates that she wants to talk to you."
  gts_linglu.1a: "Establish Communication"
  gts_linglu.2.desc: "I know your little ship just scanned me inside and out, didn't you? Shouldn't you compensate me for that?"
  linglu_leader: "§G Silent Suzuka §!"
  gts_linglu.2a: "About Your Background"
  gts_linglu.2a.respond: "I'm a member of the Tracen Academy. According to your calendar, it was probably 200 years ago. The Uma Musume, including me, at Tracen Academy gradually gained gigantification powers. Seeing that our home planet would eventually be destroyed by us, we left our home and traveled around."
  gts_linglu.2b: "About Gigantification Abilities"
  gts_linglu.2b.respond: "I'm not quite sure either. When I passed by the Three Goddess Statue, a warm current entered my body, and then the next day while training with Special Week, I suddenly felt that I had obtained this ability called gigantification. It seems that I can grow to be even larger than a solar system."
  gts_linglu.2c: "About the Little Person in Your Shoe"
  gts_linglu.2c.respond: "He's my trainer from when I was still at Tracen Academy. I often satisfy some of his unique fetishes. And it seems that the larger I become, the safer my trainer is living in my shoe. Also, it's not necessarily just living in my shoe; it could be other places. (Laughs)"
  gts_linglu.2d: "Can we contact the little person on you?"
  gts_linglu.2d.respond: "Sure.\n\n§H(Static of channel change)§!\n\nHello, I am Silent Suzuka's trainer. You can call me Old Zheng, or Zheng Gong would also do. I am currently living inside Silent Suzuka's right shoe. If you have anything you want to ask...\n\n§H(Static of channel change)§!\n\nThat's the end of the connection, you talk too much, Trainer-san. (Stomps her right foot forcefully)"
  gts_linglu.2e: "About the Little People You've Stepped On"
  gts_linglu.2e.respond: "I can't remember how many little people I've crushed. It's unavoidable, isn't it? They are so small, I accidentally step on them when I'm not paying attention. They are simply too weak."
  gts_linglu.2f: "About Other Uma Musume From Your Academy"
  gts_linglu.2f.respond: "I even ran into Special Week not too long ago. We relaxed on a planet for a whole day, and after I fed her something, she fell asleep while using my thigh as a pillow."
  gts_linglu.2g: "Can We Touch Your Tail?"
  gts_linglu.2g.respond: "You can try, if you have the ability and the life left to do so. (Lifts foot)"
  linglu_leader_desc: "Silent Suzuka, along with her little person trainer in her shoe, has been traveling the stars for over 200 years. She now serves as a national research advisor. (Please provide shrinking cities and planets on schedule)"

  gts_rawls.10.C: "§G Silent Suzuka §!"
  gts_linglu.1000.name: "No Longer Motivated"
  gts_linglu.1000.desc: "It has been five years since Silent Suzuka joined our nation. Recently, whether she's exploring the universe in a research vessel or acting as a science advisor at the capital's research center, she no longer has the enthusiasm and focus she had at the beginning. She seems completely listless. At the same time, we've also noticed that Silent Suzuka has been consuming more and more shrunken cities and planets recently, which is completely beyond the normal scope of individual consumption."
  gts_linglu.1000.a: "Perhaps it's time to check on her"
  gts_linglu.1000.a.tooltip: "§H We can now contact Suzuka through Rawls §!"
  gts_linglu.1001.a.desc: "My tail seems a bit rough. Was the atmosphere on the planet I landed on yesterday a problem... um? Is there something you need?"
  gts_linglu.1001.b.desc: "The feeling of stepping on cities built by the little ones is no different from stepping on lawns, and even... it's a bit addictive.\n\nAh, it's nothing."
  gts_linglu.1001.c.desc: "When I'm with Special Week, I end up consuming a lot more than usual.\n\nWhat should I do..."
  gts_linglu.1001.d.desc: "A comparison report of the tactile sensations of cities shrunken by 10,000 times versus 100,000 times… what are you even researching! §Y(Blushing)§!"
  gts_linglu.1001.e.desc: "Special Week came to visit me again a few days ago. We ran for a long time in the grass, but it still didn't feel like enough. What should I do? Should I add more facilities?"
  gts_linglu.1001.f.desc: "Stop it! Stop moving! Oh, it's you, nothing, it's just that my trainer in my shoe is being restless again. §Y(Stomps right foot on the ground)§!"
  gts_linglu.1001.g.desc: "Little people, cities, planets, I've stepped on quite a few today. §Y(Laughs)§!"
  gts_linglu.1001.h.desc: "Want to know what's inside Building 7? Hmm... if I shrink you and put you in my pocket, I could bring you in. But in return, you know, right? Heh."
  gts_linglu.1001.i.desc: "I accidentally got a little person's city stuck in my hair... I only noticed when I looked in the mirror... how, how embarrassing..."
  gts_linglu.1001.a: "It's nothing, I won't bother you for now."
  gts_linglu.1001.b: "Has anything been bothering you recently?"
  gts_linglu.1001.c: "Suzuka, do you plan to continue expanding the research center?"
  gts_linglu.1001.d: "(Suzuka gives you a gift)"
  gts_linglu.2000.desc: "Yes, a little.\n\nI've been using shrunken cities and planets for a while now, and I'm a bit tired of it. I really want to use actual cities.\n\nIf possible, could you give me a planet? I promise I can build the most advanced research center in the entire universe on that planet, but, regardless of what I do on this planet, please don't interfere, alright?"
  gts_linglu.2000.a: "We don’t have a suitable planet for now."
  gts_linglu.2000.b: "We can give you a planet."

  gts_linglu.2002.name: "First Phase Research Project Launched"
  gts_linglu.2002.desc: "Silent Suzuka, gigantified to a size of a thousand to a hundred thousand times her normal size, has begun to flatten mountains, river valleys, and other natural landforms as the foundation for a new research base. The tremors caused across the entire planet have affected the daily lives of the residents. But the compensation given by Suzuka is simply too much, and the residents have not voiced any complaints."
  gts_linglu.2002.a: "Hopefully, nothing will go wrong."
  gts_linglu.2003.name: "First Phase Research Project Completed"
  gts_linglu.2003.desc: "A year has passed, and a research center has been built on the land that was originally flattened into a footprint plain. In the center are a tall research center and a series of supporting residential facilities. But perhaps because Suzuka is an Uma Musume, a large area behind the building has been built as a huge racecourse and various training grounds. According to Silent Suzuka, all the income from the races is invested in the planet's infrastructure."
  gts_linglu.2003.a: "It does look like something has indeed been built."
  gts_linglu.2004.name: "The Grand Race"
  gts_linglu.2004.desc: "The first [event_target:linglu_planet.GetName] Grand Race has begun today.\n\nThe live broadcast is being shown nationwide. In addition to the race footage, several small boxes have been added to the top of the screen, each displaying the current stomping situation of each Uma Musume.\n\n§M Live Commentary: \"Under these clear skies, six Uma Musume are challenging the [event_target:linglu_planet.GetName] Research Center's 1800 km racetrack. The most popular is Silent Suzuka, currently 1.71 kilometers tall and the current head of research.\" §!\n\n§E Commentator: \"Everyone is full of energy, their expressions are great!\" §!\n\n§M Live Commentary: \"The loading is completed, and the contestants are ready to start.\" §!\n\nAs the gates open, six giant Uma Musume burst out, 12 huge feet over 200 meters long with horseshoes stamping heavily on the grass, sending a lot of soil flying into the air.\n\nShrunken cities reduced in size by 100 times from the research center's output are carefully placed inside the racetrack after the first bend. The relatively giant-by-ten-thousand times Uma Musume gradually approach these cities. As the leading Silent Suzuka's giant foot falls, an incomplete footprint replaces most of the city. Before the panicked little people in the shrunken city can understand what happened, the giant feet of the five Uma Musume behind Suzuka also step down in turn, completely destroying the city. It's nearly impossible to discern if not carefully compared to other footprints. But on the part of the track before the finish line, there are still thousands of cities scattered, waiting for their tragic fate. Each city is equipped with many sensors that can precisely measure who stepped on the city, how many buildings were crushed, and how many little people were killed.\n\nAs the race continues, it soon reaches the final bend. Along the way, many cities have been trampled into footprints by the leading Suzuka. A few cities that are lucky enough to avoid Suzuka's trampling still have to endure the trampling of the remaining 5 Uma Musume. Avoiding all of them is simply impossible. Even if they are not directly stepped on, they will be shattered by the shockwaves generated by giant feet landing.\n\n§M Live Commentary: \"Through the fourth bend, heading to the straight track!\"§!\n\n§E Commentator: \"How will the Uma Musume make their moves? I can't take my eyes off it!\"§!\n\n§M Live Commentary: \"The first to get out of the bend is Silent Suzuka! She is 8 lengths ahead of the second place! Is it possible for others to catch up!\"§!\n\n§M Live Commentary: \"Silent Suzuka is running calmly! The distance from behind grows steadily, maintaining the lead!\"§!\n\n§M Live Commentary: \"Silent Suzuka! By a large margin, she crossed the line! Dominating the race, she crushed a total of 1277 cities. The second-place finisher crushed 266 cities, and the third-place finisher crushed 254 cities...\" §!\n\nAfter the race, some lucky cities that have not been trampled will be kept for the next race. The unfortunate cities that have been flattened will be dug out and put into trash bags by the staff and replaced with new cities. If there are no races for a long time, the intact or partially destroyed cities will be left to the Uma Musume who participated in the race to dispose of them.\n\nThe method devised by Suzuka has greatly increased the viewership of the race. It is expected that the entire nation will be paying attention to each race from now on.\""
  gts_linglu.2004.a: "Great, I'm watching, I love it!"
  gts_linglu.2004.a.tooltip: "§H I'm really looking forward to the next race §!"
  gts_linglu.2005.desc: "I do have plans in that direction, but relying solely on the output of this one planet to build an equally large or even larger facility feels a bit insufficient.\n\n§Y(Suzuka flips through the documents in her hand)§!\n\nIf you could provide some funding, I would be extremely grateful."
  gts_linglu.2005.a: "We don't have any spare resources to allocate at the moment."
  gts_linglu.2005.b: "Okay, I will fund some resources."
  gts_linglu.2006.desc: "I'll go prepare right away!\n\n§Y(An excited Suzuka runs out and starts gigantifying to flatten the land)§!"
  gts_linglu.2006.a: "(Why are so many shrunken people needed?)"
  gts_linglu.2007.name: "Second Phase Research Project Completed"
  gts_linglu.2007.desc: "Another year has passed, and several shorter buildings have sprung up around the original research building. These buildings assist the main building in various research activities. According to the statistics report, the most popular research department is §H “big and small” §!, and many people have had to fight tooth and nail to even get an interview. \n\nAmong so many buildings, Building 7, marked as 'Uma Musume Only,' is particularly eye-catching. Many Uma Musume from non-research departments also go in and out. The person who goes in and out most frequently is an Uma Musume wearing an ill-fitting white coat. It is said that she often obtains shrunken people through various means for all sorts of cruel experiments.\n\nMoreover, many more facilities that can be recognized immediately as being for the use of Uma Musume have also been added, which has also boosted the tourism industry of this planet. On race days, people from all over the country come to the track just to witness the races between giant Uma Musume."
  gts_linglu.2007.a: "(We still don't know why so many shrunken people are needed.)"
  gts_linglu.2008.name: "Room 0204 Record"
  gts_linglu.2008.desc: "Silent Suzuka and Special Week, who had just finished training, arrived at the entrance to Room 0204 on the 7th floor. Suzuka adjusted the speed of the room’s time flow shown on the monitor next to the door from one second per day, to real time. The two took off their shoes outside the door and went into the room. Upon entering the room, they saw a vast urban area that was 4000 times smaller than the two Uma Musume. While Suzuka was surprised by the speed of these little people's development, Special Week, who had already lost her patience, was the first to step into the city.\n\nThe two people's black-stockinged feet and white-stockinged feet, emitting a slight white steam, stepped into the city. The slightly tingling sensation made them feel comfortable. For both of them, trampling cities was always accompanied by a hint of sexual excitement. Soon, the two's underwear showed a hint of moisture as they were stomping incessantly, and their faces gradually turned red. Suzuka, who couldn't restrain herself first, walked in front of Special Week and pushed her over. \n\nSuzuka pressed down on Special Week, scooped up a piece of intact street with her hand, and rubbed it on Special Week's underwear. After it was completely crushed into pieces, she then scooped up another intact piece.      before the fourth time, clear liquid could be seen connecting Special Week's underwear and Suzuka’s hand as the resulting \"love bridge.\" Seeing Special Week who was ready, with her face flushed red and flooded with desires, Suzuka who was also becoming impatient kissed Special Week’s lips, the two giant tongues intertwining, occasionally breaking away to catch their breath before continuing to intertwine. Suzuka's hand was not idle, and while kissing, quietly slipped into Special Week’s underwear. While caressing the clitoris, she inserted into the cavity and worked her fingers. \n\nThis process lasted for a few minutes, but to the little people on the ground, it was like centuries of suffering. The slightly shaking bodies of the two Uma Musume were like earthquakes. Many buildings around them collapsed or were crushed by unintentional movements. The love fluids flowing from their crotches drowned many little people who did not have time to escape. But it ended quickly. The keen Suzuka judged from various signs on Special Week's body that she was about to orgasm. Her skillful technique further increased the intensity of the orgasm, and the love fluid she ejected even shot into the distance through her underwear, destroying several unlucky buildings.\n\n§M “It’s time for Suzuka to enjoy herself as well.”§!\n\nAfter taking a short rest, Special Week turned over, pressing against Suzuka, took off Suzuka’s underwear, and inserted a cylindrical building that she had picked up from somewhere into Suzuka’s cavity which was also already flooded with desires. The building, which was directly touching the cervix, brought great stimulation to Suzuka. Her legs suddenly tensed, flattening a large area of the district. Her slightly arched waist revealed the yellowish-brown soil underneath her. As Special Week started thrusting the building in her hand, the exterior walls of the building scraped against the folds in the cavity. Pleasure rushed to the brain like a wave. Seeing how lewd Suzuka was, Special Week’s other hand reached her chest, starting to massage Suzuka’s nipples through the competition uniform. With attacks on both sides, Suzuka was soon pushed to the edge of orgasm. The equally keen Special Week also discovered this, accelerated the movements of both hands, and just before orgasm, pushed the whole building into the cavity. The next moment, orgasm hit. The cavity walls squeezed tightly. The poor building and the little people were no match for the inward pressure from the surrounding walls of the cavity and were instantly crushed back to the original state of the cavity. The two of them, breathing heavily, lay in the ruins of the city, and the love fluids that flowed from their crotches mixed together into a large lake.\n\n§G “Special Week, next time, remember to put on a layer of film before inserting, otherwise it will be troublesome to clean up afterwards.” §!\n\n§M “Okay, got it.” §!\n\nAfter completion, the two cleaned each other’s bodies in the bathroom. After the cleanup, Suzuka readjusted the time speed in the room to one second per day, accelerating the reconstruction while waiting for the next batch of Uma Musume to come and visit.\""
