  gts_tiantiao_anomaly: "Blinking Signal"
  gts_tiantiao_anomaly_desc: "Our scientists have discovered a blinking light signal of a specific frequency in the §YTiantiao§! system. It's clearly artificial. Surrounding space is littered with debris from ships of unknown origin, age, and model, suggesting a potential ancient space battlefield. Our scientists are requesting further investigation."
  gts_tiantiao.2.name: "Barrier"
  gts_tiantiao.2.desc: "Further observation of the signal source is blocked by some kind of shielding field. Fortunately, analysis shows the field's range is limited due to disrepair. We can conduct close-range direct observation after clearing the ship debris. What should we do?"
  gts_tiantiao.2.a: "Authorize close-range observation mission"
  gts_tiantiao.3.name: "Through the Graveyard"
  gts_tiantiao.3.desc: "With the help of the Astral Navigation Engineering Department, we've cleared a path through the enormous amount of debris, reaching the edge of the shielded area. The view is astonishing… floating in space is a gigantic girl in uniform! The signal source appears to be on her. While we can't find an obvious external transmitter, it's plausible some colossal device on her maintains the signal and shielding. Upon noticing our ships, the giant girl moves towards us. Part of the shielding seems voluntarily deactivated, suggesting she's trying to communicate."
  gts_tiantiao.3.a: "Accept the signal, see what she has to say"

  NAME_gts_tiantiao_system: "Tiantiao"
  # Leader Recruitment
  NAME_gts_tiantiao: "Yangqing Tiantiao"
  DESC_gts_tiantiao: "A massive space traffic police girl, seemingly carrying some lost technology"
  gts_tiantiao_catch_phrase: "Charging complete and ready for action!"
  gts_tiantiao.4.name: "Yangqing Tiantiao"
  gts_tiantiao.4.desc: "I am the control center for local routes, the righteous space patrol officer Yangqing Tiantiao! Ahem, though there's not much to manage around here…"
  gts_tiantiao.4.a: "Who are you?"
  gts_tiantiao.4.a.response: "I am the control center for local routes, the righteous space patrol officer Yangqing Tiantiao! Ahem, though there's not much to manage around here…"
  gts_tiantiao.4.b: "Why are you so gigantic?"
  gts_tiantiao.4.b.response: "It's a long story, probably involves some biology and physics stuff that's hard to explain. I guess if I wasn't this big, I couldn't… maintain order on those tiny planets or something you can comprehend, right?"
  gts_tiantiao.4.c: "Did you create the unknown field we encountered?"
  gts_tiantiao.4.c.response: "Of course I did! That little trick comes from a shielding device in me, which besides sending and receiving signals, can generate defensive fields and has many other uses, but now it's mostly broken and can only emit signal light."
  gts_tiantiao.4.d: "What's with this space debris around you?"
  gts_tiantiao.4.d.response: "Naturally, they're from those who tried to attack me. Foolish enough to charge or shoot randomly, only to be captured for assaulting an officer (laughs). But I'm out of bio-energy now and can hardly move... \n\nCan I borrow some energy from you? Just enough for me to move and leave this junkyard! In return, I'll follow your orders temporarily, which is definitely more beneficial than harmful!"
  gts_tiantiao.4.hire_custom_tooltip: "§YYangqing Tiantiao§! has joined our empire as a §Hleader§!."
  gts_trait_leader_tiantiao_a: "Mobile Prison"
  gts_trait_leader_tiantiao_a_desc: "This leader's body (and interior) is like a prison that holds thousands of tinies. Other than relying on her metabolism, there is no way to survive here."
  gts_trait_leader_tiantiao_b: "All-Seeing Eye"

  gts_trait_leader_tiantiao_b_desc: "This leader is fervent about observing the lives of tinies on planets, particularly crime activities. However, the definition of 'crime' is often up to her..."
  # Daily Events
  gts_tiantiao.100.name: "Policegirl's Secret"
  gts_tiantiao.100.desc: "After recharging, we discovered multiple life signs inside Yangqing's enormous body from tinies living in the gaps between her body and clothing for unknown reasons! Yangqing stated these are her attackers 'detained' with nowhere to go, keeping them like pets in the crevices of clothing or pockets. Considering these crew members are tinies, they could be a valuable asset. However, given Yangqing's considerably enormous size, we might never account for all tiny crew members..."
  gts_tiantiao.100.a: "A fitting fate for prisoners indeed"
  gts_tiantiao.100.b: "Why not make efficient use of them?"
  gts_tiantiao.100.c: "I have a better idea..."
  gts_tiantiao.200.name: "Salty World"
  gts_tiantiao.200.desc: "Searching for tiny prisoners on Yangqing Tiantiao's body is arduous. The search team must scour every corner to avoid missing those hiding in the dark crevices of her attire. Having landed on her shoulder, we can only explore her sprawling body bit by bit. The exploration now splits focus: should we advance toward Tiantiao's captivating hand or explore her awe-inspiring body first?"
  gts_tiantiao.200.a: "Who doesn't love snug leather gloves? Advance to the hand!"
  gts_tiantiao.200.b: "I personally prefer the parts below the chest…"
  gts_tiantiao.210.name: "Arm Exploration, Part One"
  gts_tiantiao.210.desc: "The journey across the slender arm is suffocating, pressed closely, covered by some unknown material attire like the sky above, reminding us of our insignificance. En route to the glove, we find numerous tinies stuffed in clothing seams, wandering like zombies. Being trapped among a girl’s outfit has broken their spirits. Considering Yangqing wears leather gloves, we suspect the situation inside them is even grimmer."
  gts_tiantiao.210.a: "The world's most painful yet fulfilling prison…"
  gts_tiantiao.211.name: "Arm Exploration, Part Two"
  gts_tiantiao.211.desc: "With tension, the search team enters the steam-filled glove. To their surprise, inside this long-unremoved leather glove, there's a civilization of tinies! This society, built around ships’ remnants stuffed inside the glove, survives on dead skin, nails, and secretions fallen from Yangqing's hand, with sweat beads providing water. Sustained by her unconscious goodwill, they endure miserably. Now that we've found them, we must decide what to do."
  gts_tiantiao.211.a: "Talk with Yangqing to regularly harvest prisoners as resources"
  gts_tiantiao.211.b: "Use the parasitic refuse for sociological studies"
  gts_tiantiao.211.c: "Don't waste this precious liquid gold, let me have it!"
  gts_tiantiao.220.name: "Body Exploration, Part One"
  gts_tiantiao.220.desc: "Exploring Yangqing's body quickly presented new challenges. Externally viewing, we anticipated her vast bust would complicate exploration. Now standing at the 'mountain' base, we barely see the peak buried under her uniform’s blue canopy. Besides these towering 'peaks,' there lies a dark valley. Our limited options suggest crossing this valley is safest. Yet some propose daring her peaks to avoid being crushed between them-a suggestion from this girl infamous for crushing tinies with her breasts."
  gts_tiantiao.220.a: "Tell our researcher not to judge others by her own standards!"
  gts_tiantiao.220.b: "An occasional mountain climb is healthy, isn’t it?"
