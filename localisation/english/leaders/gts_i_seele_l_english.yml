But §B［Seele］§! seemed to be acting strangely.\n§B［Seele］§! stopped near [event_target:seele_12.GetName], her dress covering most of the planet's sky, plunging the hemisphere into darkness. Yet, the people were not panicked. As lights gradually illuminated the surface, §B［Seele］§! smiled. ‘It seems §B［Seele］§! is popular wherever she goes. This planet might make a good toy~’ ‘Hello everyone on [event_target:seele_12.GetName]§!, you must be excited to see §B［Seele］§!~. Let §B［Seele］§! satisfy you.’ The people on the planet, in their confusion, suddenly noticed §B［Seele］§!’s finger slowly approaching, crashing into the surface. The immense pressure triggered the largest earthquake in history, destroying continental plates and surface structures. Magma seeped from the cracks, its glow visible even from space. §B［Seele］§!’s finger moved slowly across the surface, flattening the rich terrain, covering it with molten lava. Ships attempting to escape into space were crushed, becoming part of this macabre artwork.\nS-ee-le~ ‘It’s done. Hmm... feels like something’s missing... Ah, this should do it.’ The few survivors, barely clinging to life, were turned to dust in another massive impact. §B［Seele］§! carefully drew a heart after her signature, completely destroying the remaining intact parts of the continent. As she admired her work, §B［Seele］§! felt a faint irritation. The defense forces of §Y[event_target:seele_12.GetName]§! had finally assembled, launching a suicidal attack. ‘How annoying. Such a bothersome toy doesn’t need to exist.’ §B［Seele］§! waved her hand impatiently, but it passed through the fleet. ‘Huh? This is troublesome. Guess I’ll have to come back and play with you later~ Be prepared to entertain §B［Seele］§! properly~’\nThe next day, when §B［Seele］§! saw the damage report for §Y[event_target:seele_12.GetName]§!, she was shocked.

Under the tiny people’s terrified gazes, she placed them into her shoe. The stifling environment and endless darkness tormented their minds and bodies. ‘It would be faster to execute them directly on the planet, so why do it this way...’ As §B［Seele］§! prepared to end their lives by placing her foot into the shoe, she paused, feeling sorrow for them.\n\n‘§B［Seele］§! is so kind.

Seawater was squeezed out of the oceans, turning deep seas into basins, continents instantly becoming fragments floating on magma. Countless bottomless cracks appeared on the planet’s surface, magma seeping through the fissures, staining the shattered ground with orange, and letting the two feel the planet’s warmth. As for the sprawling city clusters, they had already merged with the land in the squeeze, becoming negligible sacrifices in the entertainment. §B‘It felt cold at first, was that the ocean?

Meanwhile, on the planet...\n\n‘Huh, reality simulation? What’s this new game?’ A bored girl looked at the message that suddenly popped up on her screen. ‘Let’s give it a try.’ With a click, a blue light enveloped her, the blinding light seemingly tearing her eyes. When the light faded, the girl found herself lying in her room. ‘What kind of prank is this? So boring... What’s this? Size -1, EXP -0, KD Ratio -0...’ Noticing the strange panel in her vision, the girl couldn’t help but exclaim, ‘I’m already in the game?!’ After confirming it, she decided to experience this ‘game.’ ‘Only size can be adjusted? Let’s try it first.’\nBOOM! A loud noise attracted the attention of the morning streets. As the smoke from the collapsed building cleared, people were surprised to see a giant girl slowly rising from the ruins. ‘Feels like the quality is pretty good, or did I get heavier again?’ Looking around at the people staring at her, the girl marveled at the game’s realism. ‘Since it’s a game, let me enjoy it.’ Her massive shoe soles completely covered the tiny people, slamming down before they could react, crushing them into paste stuck to the shoe’s bottom. The tiny people tried to escape, but with the size difference, they couldn’t evade the girl’s shoes, being crushed into mincemeat.\n‘Do I need destruction to gain EXP? What a strange setting.’ Watching her level rise and higher size ratios become available, the tiny people at her feet had already moved some distance away, but heard the rumbling behind them. Her growing shoes closed in like walls, crushing everything in their path. The girl seemed to be feeling the changes in size ratio, stomping her feet and pressing the already cracked streets several meters deeper. ‘The shoes are a bit redundant now, don’t feel much. Let’s give them to everyone!’ She cheerfully tossed her shoes aside, incidentally toppling several buildings. Her steaming socks were directly exposed to the air, even faintly visible with the surrounding haze. ‘Let me get more comfortable.’\n\nWith her roughly ten-thousand-fold size, the girl quickly turned the entire city into dirt under her socks. The tiny people on the edge watched the massive figure leave, sighing in relief. But the darkening sky shattered their illusions. The girl’s enormous body completely covered the city’s outskirts, lying down on the vast plains as her bed. The destruction filled the last bit of EXP, marking the end of the girl’s game.

I was floating right in front of her eyes, yet somehow I could see her entire form and the surroundings, as if I had a god’s eye view.’\n‘That’s quite interesting. Then what?’ The recorder was intrigued and urged the story to continue. ‘The giantess tried to communicate with me, but I couldn’t receive any information beyond her movements. Whether it was sound or anything else, it all turned into fragmented pieces. Her body seemed intangible, passing right through me. After a few attempts, her form gradually blurred, and my perception of the surroundings became more fragmented, like being twisted by a black hole’s gravity into meaningless lines. Then I woke up.’\n\nAfter an examination, the worker showed signs of psionic abilities, though they were gradually weakening over time.

Unable to suppress her desire, §B［Seele］§! began to stroke her constantly parting labia with her fingers. §B‘If it’s just this, everyone should be fine, right...’§! Her fingers suddenly plunged into her pussy, stirring the sticky flesh. Each massage stimulated her nerves, and she gradually increased her movements, her fingers probing deeper, nearing the researchers.\n\nFeeling the strange vibrations inside her pussy, the researchers moved further inward with the collected data, reaching the cervix. More and more love juices were expelled, and some researchers couldn’t maintain their stability, being swept away by the flood of juices. If any tiny people could avoid the squeezing of her fingers and the folds, they might actually escape §B［Seele］§!’s vagina. The researchers chose to stay put, but the increasing flow of love juices overwhelmed them. §B‘Mmm... §B［Seele］§! is going to...’§! With a lewd moan, a massive amount of love juices gushed from her pussy, and the researchers could no longer remain calm, being washed out of her body by the flood.\n\n§B［Seele］§! gradually regained her composure, seeing the researchers wrapped in her love juices. Her shy face turned even redder. §B‘S-sorry... §B［Seele］§! couldn’t hold back...’§! Although the process was a bit strange and twisted, we still achieved satisfactory results... right?"

  gts_seele.78.desc: "§B‘Does everyone want §B［Seele］§!’s... love juices?’§! Seeing the tiny person’s request, a faint blush spread across §B［Seele］§!’s cheeks. Seeing the tiny person’s expectant gaze, §B［Seele］§! couldn’t bring herself to refuse. §B‘Then... alright, but just this once.’§! Despite feeling extremely embarrassed, §B［Seele］§! nodded slightly and agreed to the tiny person’s request.\n\nHer enormous body floated in the vacuum. After confirming that it wouldn’t cause any damage to the surroundings, §B［Seele］§! began collecting her love juices. Two fingers gently probed her pussy, the stimulation increasing the secretion of love juices, lubricating the process. §B［Seele］§! gradually sped up the movement of her fingers, but the pleasure couldn’t bring her to climax. Her dazed eyes inadvertently caught sight of a burning star nearby. §B‘Since it’s for the task, it should be fine.’§!\n\n§B［Seele］§!’s body suddenly disappeared from the universe. Before the accompanying personnel could figure out what was happening, they saw the star at the center of the galaxy being picked up by §B［Seele］§! and stuffed into her pussy. The millions of degrees of heat only provided a faint stimulation, and the star remained intact for only a moment before being crushed into pieces by the pressure of her vaginal walls. The high-temperature fragments clung tightly to the folds of her flesh, releasing their remaining heat. The flood of love juices caused them to burst into their final flames before being completely extinguished inside §B［Seele］§!’s pussy.\n\nThe stimulation from the star finally brought §B［Seele］§! to climax. The fragments of the star gushed out with her love juices. The pleasure made §B［Seele］§! straighten her body, easily breaking through the safety space reserved for her original size. Several planets were crushed under her feet, becoming dirt filling her foot wrinkles. The original gravitational system of the galaxy was completely altered, and the remaining planets began orbiting her body, shattering on her skin with her unintentional movements...\n\nAlthough we suffered some losses, we obtained far more love juices than expected!"

  gts_seele.79.desc: "§B［Seele］§! leaned closer to the yellowish planet, her azure eyes reflecting the faint light from the surface. Her lips parted slightly, her breath carrying cosmic dust and water vapor, condensing into pale white vortices in the vacuum. When she pursed her lips slightly, the planet’s atmosphere trembled like a thin veil. A stream of air escaped her lips, tearing the ionosphere apart upon contact, magnetic storms exploding like fireworks, instantly destroying the original atmosphere. The air, carrying the giantess’s scent, continued to increase, enveloping [Root.GetName].\n\nThe breath continued downward, pushing the stratospheric clouds aside, forming a ring-shaped void. The airflow created high-speed hurricanes, lifting the surface sand into the air. For a moment, [Root.GetName] was covered in a sandstorm, and the few remaining oases were destroyed by the hurricanes, nearly wiping out all life on [Root.GetName]. As the breath continued, the planet’s surface began to rise, and more heat was injected into the ground. The sand and rocks first turned red from the heat, then melted into liquid magma. Mantle material erupted from the depths, and the dark red magma reacted with her saliva, producing large amounts of steam. The cooled rocks re-formed the continent’s framework. The water vapor in her breath condensed into rain clouds, and a torrential downpour brought abundant precipitation, forming the primitive oceans and providing the foundation for life.\n\nThe final breath was exhaled, and the long-lasting hurricane finally began to weaken. The continent had been stripped into thin layers, and the flowing mantle, under the immense impact, broke free from gravity and flew into the air. The molten iron-nickel core continuously changed shape under inertia, and the magma rain washed over the surface, mixing with her saliva and cooling, now suitable for life.\n\n‘Is... the transformation complete?’ §B［Seele］§! watched as [Root.GetName] gradually cooled, its color fading from the initial orange-red to a dull gray. ‘Is this surface really suitable for life? Does §B［Seele］§! need to make further changes?’"

Her pale feet, as white as the moon, with toenails gleaming like pearls, trembled slightly with every movement, dictating the fate of the entire sea. §C［Bronya］§! floated beside §B［Seele］§!, her enormous body’s gravitational pull disrupting the original tides without any action. Her gray eyes reflected the azure ocean, her bare soles tinged with a coral-like pink. Their shadows cast over the sea, enveloping the entire planet in darkness, covering the floating cities in shadow.\n\n§C［Bronya］§! landed on the surface of [event_target:seele_roll_80.GetName], the immense impact creating a kilometer-deep crater in the sea. Sweat from her feet seeped into the planet’s interior, and even if fish survived the stomp, they couldn’t survive the seawater mixed with foot odor. Water poured into the gaps between her toes, forming spiral vortices, crushing coral reefs into dust. When she lifted her foot, the seawater rushed back in, creating the most magnificent waterfall in history. The remnants of cities mixed with bubbles rose to the surface, only to be swept into the abyss by the next wave.\n\n§B［Seele］§! giggled as she leaned down, slapping the sea with her palm. The moment her fingers touched the water, shockwaves formed kilometer-high waves. Underwater volcanoes awakened from the vibrations, and lava columns burst through the water, shattering into obsidian fragments upon contact with the cold water. The continuously erupting magma filled the craters, leaving an indelible mark on the planet. §B［Seele］§! then straightened up, gently patting her hands to let the debris fall from between her fingers. The rocks fell like asteroids into the water, creating giant waves, but in their eyes, they were just tiny ripples.\n\n‘Sister, come catch me~’ §B［Seele］§! skimmed across the sea, her toes creating a ten-kilometer-high arc of water. §C［Bronya］§! chuckled and gave chase, her feet carving intersecting cracks on the sea surface. As the crust groaned, tectonic plates shattered like biscuits, and seawater flowed into the fissures, evaporating into steam mixed with sweat, enveloping her feet in a faint mist. Her sudden stomp crushed several island cities into the seabed, the remnants and boiling metal flowing along her foot wrinkles, forming winding golden-red veins in the deep sea. §B［Seele］§! seized the moment to create a giant wave, splashing it toward §C［Bronya］§!’s chest. Rocks from the seabed were thrown out with the water, soaking §C［Bronya］§!’s swimsuit. The falling droplets caused tsunamis, flipping ships and drowning countless vacationers who died from their unintended actions, becoming remnants and bones on the seabed of [event_target:seele_roll_80.GetName].\n\n§C［Bronya］§! leaned down, her palms plunging into the sea, lifting a hundred-kilometer-wide curtain of water. But §B［Seele］§! dodged nimbly, the water only wetting her hair before falling back into the sea. Their play continued to tear the planet’s surface apart. Undersea mountains were flattened by their stomps, islands formed over hundreds of millions of years became material to fill gullies under their feet, and towering waves washed over the surviving cities, their flood control systems unable to prevent destruction...\n\nExhausted, the two finally lay down on the seabed. §B［Seele］§!’s back flattened the entire sea, the crust sinking under her weight into a basin thousands of miles wide. Lava flowed along her waistline, cooling into new winding mountain ranges. Her left arm casually rested on a still-intact archipelago, the earth splitting and seawater rushing in, further fragmenting the already broken islands. §C［Bronya］§! lay on her side opposite §B［Seele］§!, gazing at the resting girl. Her silver hair spread across the sea, and her toes inadvertently pierced the mantle, the erupting magma cooling into new continents.\n\n‘Sister §C［Bronya］§!, §B［Seele］§! wants a hug \\(￣︶￣*\\))’ Watching the girl’s murmur, §C［Bronya］§! couldn’t tell if §B［Seele］§! was asleep. She slowly straightened up, but a sudden strange sensation made her stop. ‘The shrinking hormone’s effect is about to wear off. If we don’t leave soon...’ §C［Bronya］§! immediately slid her hands under §B［Seele］§!, lifting her in a princess carry. Feeling her sister’s familiar scent, §B［Seele］§! hugged §C［Bronya］§! tightly in her sleep. ‘Let’s go, §B［Seele］§!.’ §C［Bronya］§! gently kissed §B［Seele］§!’s forehead, and the two disappeared in a faint flash of light, leaving behind the glass-blue world, waiting for the giantesses’ next visit...\n\nNow we can collect bodily fluids and their lost underwear from this planet."

The outer glaciers glowed with a creamy softness, and the eternally frozen planet lay quietly on her fingertip, its temperature causing the ice to melt constantly, the snow and ice bringing a faint chill to §B［Seele］§!. ‘Is it melting? Then I must eat it quickly.’\n\nHer small tongue lightly touched the North Pole, the entire ice sheet collapsing rapidly. Sweet saliva slid toward [event_target:seele_roll_84.GetName], the coldness exploding across her taste buds. The ice surface cracked into a spiderweb pattern under the saliva’s moistening, and the glaciers were rolled up by her tongue and sent into her mouth. The coldness instantly spread, the ice gradually melting in her mouth, the frozen remains and debris falling into her throat. Broken ice stuck to the tiny crevices on her tongue, providing a unique sensation as it melted.\n\n‘It tastes pretty good,’ the first lick almost completely destroyed the entire northern hemisphere. Mantle magma sprayed into the sky, the icy-blue surface gradually covered in crimson. §B［Seele］§! licked her lips, seemingly savoring the cool sensation. ‘Let’s eat it all~’ [event_target:seele_roll_84.GetName] was sent into her mouth like candy. The hard surface cracked under her teeth, the sound of rock layers shattering like biting into a chocolate shell. Her tongue swept over the planet, easily crushing it into rocks of various sizes. The molten magma core oozed from the cracks, spreading warmth across her tongue, the contrast of hot and cold sensations blooming in her mouth. The planet’s core trembled violently, scattering and disintegrating, more and more magma flowing onto her tongue and down her throat. The grainy texture of the core mixed with the smoothness brought a peculiar enjoyment.\n\nAs §B［Seele］§! swallowed the planet’s fragments, warmth and residual ice shards collided in her esophagus. The burning core cooled and fell into her stomach after a few rinses of saliva. It was completely digested in stomach acid. ‘Should I let §C［Bronya］§! sister try it too?’"

The icy planet was placed into her mouth, and [Root.GetName] was plunged into darkness. Her warm mouth was like a slowly awakening furnace, humid breath winding across the planet’s surface. The ice sheets, accumulated over billions of years, trembled first, water droplets seeping from the ice, forming thin silver lines that soon converged into rushing underground rivers. A thunderous rumble came from the base of the glaciers, ice peaks collapsing in the steam, the shattered ice falling into the newborn rivers and merging into the ocean, becoming a cradle for life. The turbulent saliva ocean fell into the newly formed sea, imprinting §B［Seele］§!’s fragrance onto [Root.GetName].\n\nHer soft tongue gently swept over the planet’s backside, the pink sky of [Root.GetName] suddenly falling. The planet’s surface was easily altered with a simple movement. The sudden high temperature melted the entire ice sea, the water flooding over the rocks. Underground magma burst from the pressure of her tongue, visibly devouring the rock surface and quickly cooling in the saliva. [Root.GetName] completed the evolution of its crust in an extremely short time. With each lick of her tongue, the ice layers of [Root.GetName] completely melted, the snow mud mixing with saliva to form new soil, nurturing countless forms of life.
