  #-Initial Traits
  tlipoca_leader_trait_a: "The Black Star that Reflects All"
  tlipoca_leader_trait_a_desc: "The road to the underworld is bustling, the wailing dragon crystals reflect the impermanence of the world. The Grim Reaper's scythe dances with conflict and opposition, and the chorus of souls is left with only silence and ashes."
  tlipoca_leader_trait_b: "The Pact of Mictlan"
  tlipoca_leader_trait_b_desc: "$tlipoca_leader_trait_b_picture$  The light of the universe is not constant, and even the stars will fall. They fall into my mouth, allowing me to speak the fifth word. Please stop here and listen, to the pain of the dead and the sorrow of the living."

  tlipoca_leader_trait_f_desc: "Wherever the Grim Reaper passes, only sadness and wailing remain.\n§T“Although a trainee Grim Reaper can indeed sign contracts with humans to expand the scale of casualties for the sake of reaping souls, we should not develop feelings for them. Human love and hate, owing and dedication... These concepts are not suitable for a Grim Reaper.”§!"
  tlipoca_leader_trait_g: "The Non-Euclidean Cube"
  tlipoca_leader_trait_g_desc: "A strange container that looks different from every angle.

  gts_tlipoca.999.desc: "The Black Star has guided me here.\nTlipoca, a trainee Grim Reaper affiliated with the Grim Reaper Tower, has answered your call."

  gts_tlipoca.999.b: "What will happen if I sign the contract?"
  gts_tlipoca.999.b.response: "In that case... I will open a feast of blood for you.\n\n§RMay the ants bow down, may all nations and countries submit to you.\nMountains of bones will rise, and a palace of gold will be open for you.§!"

  gts_tlipoca_anomaly: "Far Star Falling"
  gts_tlipoca_anomaly_desc: "An abnormal psionic signal has been detected near this planet, possibly traces left by a giantess."
  gts_tlipoca.2.name: "The Pale Flower Tree"
  gts_tlipoca.2.desc: "After preliminary analysis, the psionic signal in the §YTeotihuacan§! system has been identified as the result of the dissipation of a solidified energy aggregate that has separated from a highly intelligent life form.  The remnants of information carried by these torn fragments recognize this action as 'reaping souls'. Given that the level of constraint of these soul fragments indicates that the 'grim reaper who reaps souls' hasn't been gone for too long, we should be able to create an illusion of abundant souls by analyzing the psionic signal, and try to summon the individual in question with this."
  gts_tlipoca.2.a: "Let's do it"
  gts_tlipoca.2.a_tooltip: "Start a situation: An operation to decode this signal will be put on the agenda."
  #-Situations
  gts_situation_tlipoca: "Soul Bait"
  gts_situation_tlipoca_desc: "By reverse-engineering the psionic code, we should be able to analyze these soul fragments and formulate a signal of high-purity souls the 'Grim Reaper' would be interested in - and attract our goal to approach so that we can, if we can, engage in communication and dialogue."

  gts_tlipoca_go_effect: "We should now push the research department's decoding and compiling efforts and continuously track the team's progress."
  gts_tlipoca_stop: "Pause the Plan"
  gts_tlipoca_stop_effect: "We do not have enough resources to support this plan right now, it can be moved down our to-do list."
  # Situation reached 50%
  gts_tlipoca.3.name: "Remnants of a Dead Soul"
  gts_tlipoca.3.desc: "Shortly after the first wave of signals was sent, the research staff on duty fell into some kind of bizarre dream. The entire research pod was suddenly shrouded in a crimson red, and a cold sense of dread spread throughout the chamber. Instinctively trying to escape in the chaos, their bodies went stiff amidst the sudden change. Alone in the chamber, everything in sight was a bloody red… but before the struggling throat could let out a sound, that crimson red spoke first.\n\n§R“Tlipoca, affiliated with the Grim Reaper Tower, has come to witness… this world turning into a blood sea of swirling and tormented souls…”§!\n\nWhen they woke from their dream, the sensor equipment was buzzing with echoes, and a huge object was approaching…"
  gts_tlipoca.3.a: "We should still be more cautious"
  # Situation completed
  gts_tlipoca.4.name: "A Good Gift"
  gts_tlipoca.4.desc: "The research facility is once again shrouded by a blood moon. But this time, a real anomaly has overwritten reality. The giant object covers the glory of the stars. It is a hand, white and unlike any earthly one. A red-eyed girl in black clothes clutches the sun with her slender hand, staring with bloodshot eyes that could swallow the cosmos at the dust in front of her and the trembling 'soul containers'. For the first time, we have clearly 'seen' the giantess's body.\n\nA cloak that covers the sky envelops her body, and blood-moon-like red eyes are revealed behind her snow-white double ponytails. A delicate girl, immeasurable in size, floats in space with a sense of imbalance, and there seems to be a speck of dust on her expressionless, cute face-that's a planet that was crushed on it at some point. The brilliant stellar ring has been captured by her gravity, like a insignificant decoration on her delicate body, even though it extends for hundreds of millions of kilometers.\n\nWithout the need for any anomaly, her very body is enough to obscure the light of a star, bringing eternal night to the thousands and thousands of tiny and fragile microorganisms in this solar system. Without the need for a scythe, with just a light press of her fingertip on the planet's surface, the doomsday of destruction will engulf the entire world. The trumpet of the apocalypse is her soft murmur, the meandering storms her tiny exhalations. Disaster descends with a flick of her finger, the survival of civilization within her thoughts alone.\n\nThe flourishing world is impacted by flesh, shattered to pieces on the body. Developed civilizations are covered by flesh, imprisoned and struggling in the folds, but she doesn't even pause for this, and just brushes off the dust sticking to her. Her mere passage is a form of death sufficient to destroy civilizations. It is not that she deliberately wants to exterminate these pitifully wailing lives, but rather that those specks of dust and the microorganisms that inhabit them happen to be on her line of travel.\n\nThe refined and cute face and the indifference to life and death, the petite posture and the sky-covering scale, the overlapping layers of mist made you feel a touch of curiosity for her. And she also seems to have noticed your thoughts. The psionic signal, which had aligned with our communication channel at some point, appeared on the communication interface, like a tiny raven feather landing on the surface of water.\n\n§T“Speak your request, mortal. I will execute it for you.”§!"

  gts_tlipoca.100.name: "§R Red Night §!"
  gts_tlipoca.100.desc: "At first, there was a graceful figure. Then, a crescent moon. Until the sky was replaced by a blood-red full moon, it was the pupil of §Y Tlipoca §! obscuring the continent. After slightly restraining her form, she embraced the small planet, her petite body replaced the colony's view. Her white hands and feet turned everything they touched into ruins equally. The home planet where generations lived was enveloped by the soft sky and shattered beneath her. The space fleet they were proud of was captured by her body's gravity, turning to ashes on her frame. The chosen ones felt fear, felt terror, yet unable to escape, nowhere to escape, as they watched her extend her soft tongue and lightly sweep across the surface of the continent. Cityscapes that stretched to the clouds, massive and complex ecosystems-they were just insignificant dust that her pink tongue had touched or pulverized. After all, the tip of her tongue alone had already pierced the planet's atmosphere. To compare such a gigantic entity with a soul that was still bound by gravity was too much of a bully. Faced with such a difference in scale, all that the people could do was to watch the Grim Reaper girl, whose fingertip began to drag across the continent, using them as a temporary amusement, watching how she bestowed the fated end on the living things on this planet." #\nThe total population of the empire：[this.gts_tlipoca_empire_pop]\nThe 5% of empire population：[this.gts_tlipoca_empire_pop_5_percent]\nTlipoca harvest count：[this.gts_tlipoca_kill_count]

  gts_tlipoca.401.name: "Message from a Distant Star System-A Huge Monster"
  gts_tlipoca.401.desc: "This was the darkest day in history-perhaps from a physics point of view. A white-haired girl slowly poked her head from the other side of the horizon, obscuring the light from the star with a cute gesture. Her crimson pupils swept across the entire sky, plunging the whole world into panic.\nWatching the minute details of the planet's surface, §Y Tlipoca §! tilted her head, unintentionally crushing the space station next to her ear. The giant body floated in the sea of stars. Countless particles of what were once known as celestial bodies adhered to her pure white flesh. Between the fingers touching her lip were the planetary orbital defense facilities that had once tried their best to attack, but failed to attract the slightest attention. Not even leaving a trace, this civilization's most advanced weapons sank into the folds of soft flesh that were unconsciously rubbed to pieces.\n\n§T“This place doesn't seem like my Lord's territory, does it? My Lord wouldn't mind if I secretly harvested some souls here...§!”\n\nShe approached the small planet, her delicate pink tongue touching the surface of the mainland as if tasting the imperceptible beings on her tongue. Countless cities were submerged and swallowed by the massive amount of saliva, but to her, it was just the moistening of a few green patches. The terrifying pressure squeezed and deformed the entire planet, but it was just adding a few specks of dust. With her fingertips pinching the planet lightly, she recounted to the survivors about how the fleshy sky replaced the world they knew, cities and mountains, towers and rivers, were all part of the world crushed beneath this sky, and the life and death of all things is controlled by the girl's unconscious physical activity. It was only when the number of the living became few, less than a tenth of what they were, and only when the remains of the brick wreckage, tainted by the girl's lingering lip-smell, stood like silent tombstones all over the planet, would §Y Tlipoca §! retract her tiny and soft tongue. For the survivors, they may never forget this story- \n\n§R“When the world is filled with sin, the Grim Reaper that all beings fear will descend.”§!"

  #Got eaten by the little grim reaper 2
  gts_tlipoca.402.name: "Message from a Distant Star System-Fresh Food"
  gts_tlipoca.402.desc: "Anti-aircraft sirens pierced the tranquility of the colony, and the alarm of a huge creature's approach plunged the residents of an entire planet into unprecedented panic. This small planet, for some reason, had become a prey coveted by §Y Tlipoca §!, who was leisurely drifting from the depths of space, and a delicious snack in her eyes.\nBefore the inhabitants of the planet could react, §Y Tlipoca §! slowly opened her mouth. Her cherry-like mouth swallowed the starlight, like an abyss opening in the sky. As she lightly closed her mouth, the planet slid towards her tongue irresistibly. Yet, the surviving residents held on to a shred of hope-the planet's shield was activated at the last moment, instantly forming a barrier around the planet.  However, even with the shield's protection, the planet was in danger of collapsing under the impact of the viscous saliva gathered in her mouth, an endless expanse of liquid and viscous matter that threatened to engulf a small world. \nThe fully functioning planetary shield made it feel smooth and cold, like a mint-flavoured hard candy. §Y Tlipoca §! couldn't help but start licking the planet lightly. As her tongue swept across the surface, the shield shook slightly, and the soft, huge, pink monster coiled around the planet, almost completely enveloping it.\nWithin, the residents of the colony trembled in fear, looking up at the sky. They couldn't comprehend where this sudden catastrophe came from, let alone resist this overwhelming presence. Every lick of §Y Tlipoca §! brought shocking fluctuations. The planet's shield slightly deformed under her gentle licking, and cracks appeared in its surface, if only momentarily.  The residents could only watch helplessly as the shield was gradually torn apart, and the structure of the planet itself began to become fragile until it collapsed. \nIn the end, §Y Tlipoca §! smiled, a smile that could be considered cute.  With a light tap of her teeth, she shattered this last barrier. Giant teeth as white as pillars seemed to descend from the sky, tearing apart land, disrupting tectonic plates, and easily reducing this planet in her mouth. The planet crumbled between her lips and teeth, while she closed her eyes in satisfaction, savoring the faint taste in her mouth."

  #Little grim reaper playing with them as toys
  gts_tlipoca.403.name: "Message from a Distant Star System-Surprise Gift"
  gts_tlipoca.403.desc: "The once-peaceful sky suddenly turned dark, and endless shadows covered the light of the star. The observers were the first to notice the abnormality. While their exclamation hadn't spread throughout the planet, a white giant had already broken through the clouds, shrouding the planet in endless darkness. Initially, people thought it was a projection of some giant ship, but when the crust began to shake and the clouds were easily ripped apart, they finally realized that this was no ordinary threat. Air defense weapons aimed at the sky in emergency, but hesitated to fire-because those giant objects were a girl's fingers. This was not a ship, not an interstellar disaster, but a girl's fingers. White jade pillars pierced the sky, and their scale was beyond any measurement. The soft fleshy feel and delicate texture were clearly visible. §Y Tlipoca §! did not come to bring destruction to them. For the people on the planet, her mere presence was a disaster beyond comprehension. Delicate fingertips gently explored and penetrated into the atmosphere, and the surface of the earth was broken to pieces by her casual playing. In the sky, tens of thousands of satellites and space stations scattered as dust, with the slight movement of her fingers, dispersing in all directions. Although her movements were gentle, the sheer scale of those fingertips made resistance by any civilization meaningless. \n\n§T“This planet seems quite interesting… I hope my Lord doesn't mind?§!”\n\n§Y Tlipoca's §! voice echoed across the colony, the surface of the earth trembling as if doomsday had arrived. She tilted her head, skilfully pinching the two poles of the planet with her fingertips and gently squeezing it. The city skyline began to tilt. When residents looked out of their windows, they could only see the entire sky replaced by soft, flesh-coloured skin. §Y Tlipoca §! lifted the planet to her face. Some curiosity flickered in her red eyes. She gently rubbed the surface of the planet with her fingertip, feeling the minute protrusions on this small celestial body. Those cities and mountains that were once praised as their civilization's prides were now nothing more than small and indistinct dots between her fingerprints. Without further destruction, without any additional movements, she simply held the planet in her palm, turned around and walked towards the deep space. Through increasingly damaged sensors, the people on the planet could only watch their world being taken into the distance by white fingertips, and disappear at the end of the galaxy."

  #Got stepped on by the little grim reaper
  gts_tlipoca.404.name: "Message from a Distant Star System-Fun Prank"
  gts_tlipoca.404.desc: "In the dark universe, §Y Tlipoca §! slowly raised a foot. Her snow-white skin appeared soft and beautiful under the starlight. She slightly curled her toes and gently poked the planet. The whole planet was moved by her gesture, tottering under her toes. The cities on its surface experienced unprecedented tremors. Buildings collapsed under the light touch of her slender toes. Countless residents were agitated amidst the earth-shattering earthquakes. They looked up in fear at the girl who brought them disaster with her toes.\n\nAbove the cities, the boundless shadow of §Y Tlipoca's §! huge, white, and flawless feet covered the entire view like a sky. §Y Tlipoca's §! slender toes moved slightly at the edge of people's vision, triggering a massive earthquake that shook the land beneath them. Each bending and extending toe was a disaster, causing countless cracks to form in the buildings and sending dust flying. Some people knelt on the ground in despair, looking at the white soles of her feet as they slowly descended, like watching for the arrival of a fated doomsday. Others desperately tried to rush towards underground shelters, but the ground beneath their feet began to shatter and collapse due to the tremors caused by her footsteps. The hope of escape became more distant. The city became ruins under her feet, the buildings broke and fell between her toes, as fragile as sand. Every time §Y Tlipoca's §! toes touched lightly, the ground trembled beneath her feet. §Y Tlipoca §! smiled slightly, gently rotating her ankle, and placing her toes at the very center of the planet, and then gradually increasing her strength, with her soft toes, she slowly penetrated into the planet's mantle. Beneath her white and flawless feet, the planet’s crust shattered like icing sugar, and the broken ground with countless ruins filled in the curve under  her feet, constructing a doomsday scene for the planet. She merely needed to move one step slightly to turn this colony into ruins, but to her this was just a casual game. As her sole gently crushed everything on the planet, the last hope on the horizon also disappeared. People's despair and fear turned into silence, dissipating under the feet of this gigantic entity. Only the slowly falling white sole was the last thing they could see."

The darkness woven by raven wings enveloped the warships and the sky. The light and starlight are silenced under her cherry lips. For the unfortunate ships that had sunk into the ocean of saliva, Tlipoca's tiny tongue became something even more terrifying than a Stellar Devourer. Just a skillful sweep between her teeth and the raging waves would cause a fragile tin can to drift and shatter against her tender and soft flesh."

Snow-white teeth showed slightly, and a soft tongue reached out from her cherry lips, its delicate pink surface trembling slightly, as if looking forward to this small and delicate feast. It is not as if no one tried to defy their fate. Those who tried to escape the disaster by setting the throttle at full speed were contained by the sticky saliva, and crashed between her white and jade-like teeth; those who hoped that a final blow with their strongest gun would inflict any damage, even the slightest, on her sensitive mouth became mere morsels from an involuntary swallow, were annihilated within the narrow oesophagus. Her tightly closed lips completely sealed off all hope for escape, and the remaining screams were just fleeting echoes bouncing around in her mouth. The alloy-forged hull would distort under the gentle caress of her tongue, releasing a miserable groan, while some of the less fortunate ones would be crushed alive within the deformed iron shells. The surviving lucky ones could only watch helplessly as they and their warships slid down into the endless abyss, to become insignificant fodder for the girl.\n\n§T“It would have been nice to have a little more… but, these little guys were not a bad snack at all.”§!\n\n§Y Tlipoca §! closed her eyes, feeling the last drop of soul dissolve within her body. Within her soft and tender abdominal wall, only the echoes of endless wails remained."

  # Generating Zero is more logical than generating dark matter, by a bit
  gts_tlipoca.602.name: "Slaughter Disposition"
  gts_tlipoca.602.desc: "Her giant palm seemed to close slowly, yet no ship could escape its enveloping range.  The shadow that covered the sky with enormous terror engulfed the enemy fleet. All the ship's weapons fired, trying to prevent her fingers from closing even by a fraction of a millimeter, yet the result was futile. Neither kinetic nor energy weapons could do anything but create tiny sparks on her palm, and they could not even leave a single mark on her flawless flesh, let alone prevent §Y Tlipoca §! from gathering the entire fleet into the palm of her hand. There was no need to look at the display to see the fine texture of her giant palm; - like finely carved white jade or soft velvet. It was this cute 'little hand' that had become the grim reaper that decided their fate.\n\nHer five fingers slowly closed, the motion was not rushed, and could even be called gentle, yet for the fleet trapped in her palm, it was no different from the coming of the end. There was no possibility of resistance for the fleet trapped in her palm. The ship bodies warped and tore apart under the irresistible force. They were ultimately reduced to hot metal debris in a soundless explosion, splashing around in her soft palm.\n\nThis was an uneventful battle-if such a one-sided massacre could even be called a battle. There was no fierce confrontation, nor any desperate shouts, only her gentle yet irresistible action, which crushed the enemy's once formidable fleet, along with their hopes. And she would just gently complain, as if regretting that those entities were too fragile to have pleased her.\n\n§T“Too weak… Perhaps, it will be more fun next time?”§!"

  # The ships in her stomach melt and turn to alloy, (relatively) the most logical episode
  gts_tlipoca.603.name: "Finishing Work"
  gts_tlipoca.603.desc: "§T“I’m… I’m sorry. Tlipoca should not have eaten them… without asking you… sob…”§!\n\nAt the other end of the communication interface, the “petite” girl who was reporting the results was wringing her hands, looking embarrassed.  §Y Tlipoca §! after a victorious battle, perhaps because she was too hungry, had accidentally eaten the wreckage of enemy warships that had been shot down, even though these metal particles floating in deep space couldn't even fill the gaps between her teeth. And when she was idly stroking these small alloy compartments with her tongue, she was reporting to you about the merits of the fleet in the protection of her finger tips.  Your casual inquiry as to the whereabouts of the enemy wreckage made her constantly apologize, forcing you to confusedly appease the girl who was trembling because she was afraid of being fired. Even though you explained over and over again that those things eaten were eaten, she still insisted on salvaging the “recyclable resources” in her stomach. Helpless, you could only agree to her “small” request, and send an engineering salvage team from a nearby starbase.\n\nFollowing her slightly opened mouth and deep into her narrow oesophagus, one found that under the scale of a celestial body, even passing through a small part of her body was more extensive for us than any interstellar journey. Entering her stomach was no different to entering a different world. The pulsating pink fleshy walls made up the colour of the world. The pulsation inside her was a roar that reverberated to your ears, and at the bottom of the world, the boiling acidic ocean was so vast that even if you threw in hundreds of planets at a time, it would disappear in an instant. The salvage team's shuttle skimmed over the acidic surface, dodging every wave that threatened to be fatal, and began to look for the mechanical debris that hadn't completely dissolved. Every salvage required patience and luck, after all, even for a moment, the corrosiveness of the giantess' stomach acid was enough to degrade several types of strong alloy. Picking out machinery that was still usable from the giantesses' acidic sea was like playing a gacha game, as you would never know if you'd get a dark matter engine from the next salvage pull.\n\nThe recycling operation was completed quickly. After all, salvaging and recovering the recyclable materials from the acidic sea, and cleaning up the alien garbage that was struggling in the acid-eaten iron shells, was something that we were already all too familiar with. Despite the fact that the process of salvaging these alloys was complex and the reward was low, it was just a means to make the girl happy."
