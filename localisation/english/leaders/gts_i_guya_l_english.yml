  gts_guya.1.b: "Attempt to hatch it"
  gts_guya.2.name: "Hatched"
  gts_guya.2.desc: "The hatching process went smoothly. The creature that emerged is a humanoid being about 50 meters tall, with an appearance very similar to a human female but also with many arthropod-like features. The newly hatched creature appears quite frail, and she seems to have recognized our scientists in charge of the hatching project as family. We should now..."

  gts_guya.3.name: "Flourishing Growth"
  gts_guya.3.desc: "The larva has grown very rapidly under the care of the researchers. Within a few months, its size has increased to nearly 100 meters, and the organs with arthropod features on its body have become more apparent. However, its form doesn't seem to have changed much, still appearing as a juvenile. Researchers speculate that the creature has already developed into adulthood, but still has the potential to continue growing. Moreover, at the current growth rate, our research institute will soon be unable to accommodate this 'larva'."

  GTS_LOLI_EGG_SPECIAL_PROJECT_DESC: "A meteorite recently crashed in the uninhabited area of §Y[gts_loli_egg_planet.GetName]§!, leaving behind debris approximately 80 meters in diameter. After preliminary surveys, we discovered that this meteorite is very likely a giant egg. Further actions await instructions."
  gts_guya.4.name: "Lost Contact"
  gts_guya.4.desc: "Our researchers on §Y[gts_loli_egg_planet.GetName]§! have not made their routine reports for three consecutive months. Communications sent by the local government have also gone unanswered. To prevent accidents, we should investigate what is happening in the protected area as soon as possible."
  gts_guya.4.a: "Dispatch a rescue team immediately"
  gts_guya.5.name: "\"Overgrowth\""
  gts_guya.5.desc: "When our rescue team arrived, they found that the entire protected area was covered by an unknown type of fungal plant. It seems that the ecosystem in this area has completely merged with these fungi, transforming into a new type of ecosystem. In the distance, there is a gray-white mountain range that has never been marked on the map. Fortunately, our researchers are unharmed, though their communication equipment and transportation have been destroyed by the rampant fungi. According to the staff inside the facility, that mountain is actually the cocoon of the Bug Girl. The fungi she secreted have rapidly covered and changed the surrounding terrain, continuously providing nutrients for her growth. Now that she is cocooned, she is about to enter the next stage of growth."
  gts_guya.5.a: "Next stage! How much longer?"
  gts_guya.6.name: "Emergence"
  gts_guya.6.desc: "The ground violently shakes, and the huge cocoon begins to slowly break apart. What emerges is the Bug Girl’s alien yet graceful body. She has now grown to an alarming size of 3km. Upon hatching, she is more slender than before, but a pair of large wings have grown on her back. She spreads her wings in the sunlight, shakes off the mucus, and flies into the sky....\n\nAfter the storm caused by the Bug Girl's takeoff subsides, we immediately contacted the near-orbit monitoring station to find the Bug Girl's location. However, we were instead contacted by government officials from the nearby city. It seems that her wings did not help her break through the atmosphere and escape gravity’s grasp. The Bug Girl crashed in the farmland on the outskirts of the city. One of her wings has been broken at a horrifying angle, and there are burn and frostbite marks all over her body. The Bug Girl's painful moans echo throughout the suburban area. We must take further action."

  gts_guya.9.a: "Continue investigating"
  GTS_LOLI_BUG_MOM_SPECIAL_PROJECT: "Parental Recognition?"
  GTS_LOLI_BUG_MOM_SPECIAL_PROJECT_DESC: "That Bug Girl might have recognized our scientist as her mother. Perhaps we should try to let them recognize each other."
  gts_guya.10.name: "Parental Recognition?"
  gts_guya.10.desc: "§Y[gts_loli_bug_mom.GetName]§!'s ship slowly landed on the Bug Girl's palm. The Bug Girl brought her face close to the palm, getting closer and closer... Wait, that's too close!"
  gts_guya.10.a: "I have a bad feeling about this"
  gts_guya.11.name: "Accident"
  gts_guya.11.desc: "§Y[gts_loli_bug_mom.GetName]§! was eaten in one gulp. But just as our mobile forces were about to launch an attack, we suddenly received communication from §Y[gts_loli_bug_mom.GetName]§!.\n\n'Don't... don't worry, she didn't... um... hurt me. I just don't know, woah! Don't know what she's going to... haa... do to me...'"
  gts_guya.11.a: "She sounds kind of excited, it shouldn't be a problem, right?"
  gts_guya.12.name: "Mother"
  gts_guya.12.desc: "Two hours after §Y[gts_loli_bug_mom.GetName]§! was swallowed, the Bug Girl finally made a new move. Her belly swelled, and we could almost see some kind of living creature writhing inside. Soon, the Bug Girl lowered her body and began to give birth. A pod with a diameter of nearly 300 meters slowly slid out from the Bug Girl's vulva, along with some viscous liquid, and finally fell to the ground. Soon after being expelled, the pod hatched, and the giant figure that emerged from it was none other than §Y[gts_loli_bug_mom.GetName]§!, who had been swallowed earlier. Although the body structure is no longer human, she still retains a human outline and her mind seems unchanged. After taking some time to adapt to her towering height, §Y[gts_loli_bug_mom.GetName]§! told us that she has now merged with the Bug Girl on a genetic level, becoming a ‘mother’ in the true sense, and now, the Bug Girl will completely obey our commands. Of course, out of her maternal love, she gave the Bug Girl a name, “Guya”, same as her moans. Additionally, she mentioned that the growth potential of this Bug Girl is far more than that. We can choose to tap into that potential to better serve the nation or maintain the status quo to save unnecessary expenditures."

  gts_guya.20.name: "\"Guya's Growth - I\""
  gts_guya.20.desc: "Under our cultivation, Guya's size has reached a level of 6km, and she has also reproduced a group of Bug Girl offspring ranging from 10-25 meters. Guya's internal hormone levels have also increased due to this, and her temperament has become more volatile. Perhaps we can unleash her anger on our enemies?"

  gts_guya.21.desc: "Guya's growth momentum has far exceeded our expectations, and within just a few months, her size has reached an astonishing 60km. Now, every move she makes affects the entire planet. Many residents have begun to complain about the earthquakes and storms caused by Guya's movements. If we want to continue Guya's development, we may have to move the facility to orbit."

The gravity effect created by her massive body has even altered the tidal patterns on the planet. Now, the food we provide is completely unable to satisfy Guya's appetite. Such a huge Guya can only satisfy her hunger by preying on asteroids and passing space creatures."

  gts_guya.23.a: "It’s a good thing she's on our side."
  # Guya Leader Events
  gts_guya.30.name: "Oviposition"
  gts_guya.30.desc: "Guya crawls towards the enemy capital on all fours, the immense mass of her six-kilometer-tall body shaking the ground, the giant tremors launching nearby ambushing ground troops into the air, only to smash them to pieces upon impact. Some of the troops ambushing along Guya's path are crushed unconsciously by Guya before they can even reorganize from the chaos caused by the earthquake. The enemy's deployed ground forces are annihilated by Guya without even having a chance to open fire. Even the air forces fare no better than the ground troops. Even when crawling, Guya's speed easily exceeds the speed of sound, leaving conventional fighters unable to keep up. The sonic booms generated by Guya's high-speed movement create gusts of wind around her, tearing apart the few fighters that can keep up. Within minutes, Guya arrives outside the suburbs, stops, and prepares to guide the subsequent air drop of troops. Realizing that a head-on attack is unlikely to succeed, the enemy decides to use chemical weapons against the giant Bug Girl. A squadron of fighters drops numerous gas bombs on Guya, the resulting cloud of poison gas completely enveloping her. Soon, accompanied by a massive vibration and hoarse moans, Guya stumbles out of the gas cloud, though for some reason, she has a blush on her face. It seems that the poison gas has had some other effect on Guya – she is in heat!\n\nHer face flushed, Guya lowers her upper body, raising her hips high, the overflowing juices of her private parts glistening in the sunlight. Suddenly, Guya's lower abdomen swells slightly, and then a giant insect egg, more than 50 meters in diameter, is discharged from her vulva along with viscous love fluids, falling directly into the city below. The white insect egg, over 50 meters in diameter, carries an unimaginable mass as it falls from the sky, shattering an entire residential area, the love fluids that drip from it demolishing the surrounding buildings that hadn't fully collapsed. The insect egg, at over 50 meters, is only the size of a sesame seed for Guya – the oviposition has only just begun. Accompanied by rapid, panting breaths, insect eggs begin to discharge from Guya's vulva at a rate of hundreds per second. The mountain of eggs collapses after reaching its maximum height, the eggs rolling down with viscous fluids in every direction, easily crushing all the surrounding buildings without slowing down at all. Seemingly to prevent the density of the insect eggs from becoming too high, Guya starts to slowly move forward while continuing to accelerate her egg production, laying eggs that are accompanied by overflowing love fluids, leaving a trail like a snail's slime line in her wake. The dripped love fluids release copious amounts of hormonal pheromones, and the air currents stirred up by Guya's panting cause these lewd pheromones to quickly spread, transforming the survivors in the entire city into sex-crazed zombies. It won't be long before the insect eggs hatch, and those who have lost themselves to Guya's pheromones will become the larvae's first meal."
  gts_guya.30.a: "Feast! Feast!"
  gts_guya.31.name: "Insatiable Lust"
  gts_guya.31.desc: "With her immense size, Guya easily crushes the enemy's defensive forces. Guya lowers her body, creating gusts of wind that sweep through the entire city, hurling vehicles and pedestrians into the air only to smash them to pieces when they land. This one simple act of bending over resulted in thousands of casualties, but this was only the beginning. Cloud-like fungi secrete from Guya's back and swiftly spread through the city. The surviving residents who come into contact with the fungi instantly become paralyzed, frozen in place, their emotions suppressed to the point of apathy. They blankly watch as the purplish-green substance slowly crawls all over them, knowing they're going to die but feeling nothing about it. Even the slightest curiosity about their situation is gone. The remaining residents can only helplessly watch the giant figure in the sky slowly approach, patiently waiting like lambs being led to slaughter. The fungi clouds soon cover the entire city, and when the city is 'ready for consumption,' the hungry Guya opens her mouth as wide as she can. Four tongue-like tentacles extend from the purplish-red abyss within, sucking in everything on the ground. The entire city is like a cookie sprinkled with icing, quickly devoured by Guya. With her appetite temporarily satisfied, what remains to be addressed is her lust, her fingers slowly sliding down her body towards her clitoris, which is swollen with repressed desire. But this is not enough. In search of a toy to help her, Guya crawls towards a nearby city. Accompanied by massive vibrations and heavy breathing, the residents in the other city see the face of a super-giant Bug Girl lolita, full of need, slowly covering the entire sky. The feeding fungi have stopped being secreted as Guya's brain is overcome with 'sperm,' and the city’s residents can only await their doom in terror. Guya scoops up large sections of buildings and crudely inserts them into her overflowing vagina, buildings and humans being crushed within the soft flesh of the vagina. The debris and love fluids mix together, being rubbed against the surrounding flesh with every insertion and withdrawal, bringing double the pleasure and stimulation. The buildings and residents are ground to dust with each thrust and then digested by the corrosive love fluids to become the vagina's nutrition. Large swathes of the city are excavated by Guya, becoming toys for her masturbation, and finally, Guya reaches orgasm. The gushing love fluids crush the last remaining bit of the city. After her orgasm, Guya touches her stomach. It seems she's hungry again......"
  gts_guya.31.a: "Then let's fill her belly with them!"
  gts_guya.32.name: "Careless Play"
  gts_guya.32.desc: "As a 60-kilometer 'flagship,' Guya is immediately marked as an attack target by all enemies. All kinds of weapons pour their firepower onto Guya's ‘tiny’ body. The hit rate is almost 100%, and such fierce firepower would be enough to turn half the surface of a planet into scorched earth, but for the giant Bug Girl, it's merely akin to a few sparks against her skin. Among the plankton-like fleet, only the enemy's flagship attracts Guya's attention. This giant ship, at one point, was sweeping the battlefield with its size advantage, but it is now reduced to a plaything in the hands of the ‘little’ girl. Curiously, Guya stretches out her finger and pinches the warship in front of her. The shields stretched to their full power cause the warship to become stuck between the finger pad, like a ping pong ball. Just the pressure from the finger is enough to overload the shield. The warship in the Bug Girl's hand has lost the strength to so much as struggle, but Guya, looking at the motionless ‘toy’ in her hand, feels a bit bored, and the fingers slightly releases the pressure. The instant Guya released her finger, the warship, which had long been waiting for the opportunity, immediately opened up its engines and attempted to flee. Seeing the toy drift away like a bubble in the wind, Guya adjusts her posture and gently encloses the escaping ‘toy’ with her feet. The collision between the soft and tender soles of the lolli bug girl's feet and the giant vessel made of rigid alloy. The winner was obvious. Guya's movements with her feet were not nearly as refined as her movements with her fingers. The overloaded energy shield was shattered before even allowing the sensitive nerves on the sole of her foot to feel a thing, and the tough alloy hull of the ship was slowly crushed by the amazing mass of her toes. The entire flagship was submerged in an ocean of soft toe flesh like this. Some of the surviving crew members fall from the wreckage into her toe creases, but their fates are even more tragic. Unlike humans, the glands on the Bug Girl’s body do not secrete sweat, but rather, they secrete hormones used to lure prey. The little people that fall into Guya's toes are instantly captivated by the massive amount of pheromones, being transformed into parasites that can only go into heat within her toe prints. The battle ends in such a state of unconscious play by the Bug Girl."
  gts_guya.32.a: "The previous investment was worthwhile"
  gts_guya.33.name: "Predation"
  gts_guya.33.desc: "The hair-like structures on Guya's head are actually fine tentacles (ranging in diameter from 20m to 1m) used for capturing tiny prey. This time, the prey was an enemy fleet, and these agile tentacles can even perform precise manipulations down to the millimeter, making it virtually impossible for any prey to escape their capture range. Before the enemy fleet could even form a proper formation, countless tentacles stretched out, wrapping around the fleet and immobilizing it. The small ships could not provide Guya with much nutrition, but they weren't completely useless either. The tentacles wrapped around the fleet slowly moved towards Guya's lower body, where another drooling 'mouth' was waiting for food. Gently spreading open her already overflowing flower petals, she directs the tentacles to send the captured tiny ships, one by one, into the fleshy abyss, its walls coated in a special viscous substance to hold the tiny prey in place. Soon, the fungi secreted by the Bug Girl invade the ship along with a strong hormonal scent. The crew, infected by the fungi, turn into masses of formless meat that squirm and proliferate. Upon confirming that there are no survivors, Guya directs her fingers to her lower body. Her dragon-like fingers spread open the soft flesh and begin to churn the vaginal cavity, slowly pushing the prey into the place of transformation-the uterus, where they'll enjoy everything they need to grow unrestrained. The original ships become their skeletons. They'll become new warships, until Guya's next heat period comes around again."
  gts_guya.33.a: "That's what I call war economy!"
  gts_guya.34.name: "Love Fluid Fall"
  gts_guya.34.desc: "With her body's functions maturing, Guya's sexual organs have become highly active. In other words, Guya is now in perpetual heat. However, Guya believes that masturbation cannot produce offspring and would only waste valuable nutrients, thus, her instinct resists this. However, crystalline viscous fluids still seep out from the petals of her lower body. Guya can only try to ease the itchiness from the depths of her garden by grinding together her legs, but this is in vain; it only makes the lust burn more intensely. And all of this is seen by the residents of the colony below her. The innocent and naive 'petite' lolita is tormented by lust, her eyes dazed, even her body is difficult to control. This erotic scene is continuously unfolding above [event_target:gts_guya_event_planet.GetName]. Just when people were almost getting used to this sky-filling, R-rated scene, an accident happened: a mass of love fluid was splattered out as Guya's lower body contracted, falling directly towards [event_target:gts_guya_event_planet.GetName]. The massive amount of love fluid, carrying a destructive mass, crashed into an uninhabited ocean area, causing a huge tremor strong enough to shift the crust. Furthermore, global sea levels quickly rose, and countless coastal cities were flooded in a lewd atmosphere. The love fluid's immense mass caused it to remain separate from the seawater, causing a mass extinction of marine life within a thousand kilometers from the point of impact. The local government conservatively estimates that the subsequent secondary disasters and economic losses from clean-up operations will be incalculable."
