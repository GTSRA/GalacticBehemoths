Eventually, our last communication station reported the incident before all went silent.\n\nThe empire swiftly reacted, but its fleets were insignificant to the goddess. Consequently, the empire abandoned the investigation after losing over 90% of its scientists sent to study her - with none returning.\n\nThankfully, a dug-up scientist and samples remained after she vanished.\n\n'Praise the goddess for gifting us such valuable experimental materials. With them, we shall reign supreme in the universe!' - Project Leader"
