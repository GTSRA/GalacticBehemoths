  NAME_gts_sonxi: "Song Xi"
  DESC_gts_sonxi: "A seasoned researcher of tinies, passionate about tasting her subjects, both in terms of flavor and tactile experience."
  gts_sonxi_catch_phrase: "Time to set out, where are more tinies? (drooling)"
  gts_sonxi.999.name: "Song Xi"
  gts_sonxi.999.desc: "A massive bear-eared girl appears before the crowd, wearing what looks like a standard uniform dress.\n\n\"Hello. My name is Song Xi.\"\n\nShe hugs a massive book, her face radiating with warmth.\n\n\"I was passing by and noticed you have plenty of population... resources, huh? Would you mind sharing some to aid my scientific research? In return, I'm willing to share some of my research findings.\"\n\nShe adjusted her non-prescription giant glasses, but her stomach let out a grumbling sound, causing her cheeks to redden slightly. Records indicate recent interstellar disappearances of populations, and all evidence points to the bear-eared girl in front of us. Where have they gone? Perhaps only her warm belly knows."
  gts_sonxi.999.a: "Why do you want to join us?"
  gts_sonxi.999.a.response: "I was just passing through and noticed you have many tiny resources, hehe (bear drooling). Don't be so stingy, share some with me for fun, and I can help you with many things, especially scientific research."
  gts_sonxi.999.b: "Where did those missing people go?"
  gts_sonxi.999.b.response: "Oh, that's a little secret of mine! But trust me, they've gone to a warm, safe place where they no longer worry about food and live a happy new life. I'm a professional when it comes to researching and protecting tinies."
  gts_sonxi.999.c: "Is your research subject tinies?"
  gts_sonxi.999.c.response: "Yes, aren't tinies adorable? Crushing them is like crushing bugs, yet they still strive to survive anywhere.\n\nThe little bear patted her round belly, smiling happily."

  gts_trait_leader_sonxi_a_3_desc: "The populace has fully adapted to Song Xi's digestive tract, carving out new territories in mucous-filled flesh, warm and food-abundant, yet not entirely safe as Song Xi often consumes peculiar things, troubling the gut safety division."

  # Pre-recruitment Event for Song Xi
  gts_sonxi.3.name: "Sudden Appearance of a Giantess"
  gts_sonxi.3.desc: "Initially, nobody paid much attention to the anomaly reports from [gts_sleepbear_planet.GetName], until powerful electromagnetic and gravitational fields nearly tore the silence of the entire planet, until the massive body large enough to destroy an entire galaxy suddenly appeared in [gts_sleepbear_system.GetName]. We then realized this was far more than a simple anomaly.\n\nThis giantess who suddenly appeared in [gts_sleepbear_system.GetName] didn't even move, yet her snow-white stocking-wrapped feet crushed a planet, its fragmented remnants fleeing desperately, trying to escape the massive gravity of the celestial giantess, but in the end, could only futilely become bangles on her ankle.\n\nCompared to her, our star is merely a toy, shivering weakly under her breath, its heat not even a fraction of hers...\n\nFortunately, according to our observations, this civilization-erasing giantess seems to have fallen asleep for some reason, which might be good news, as long as we don't disturb her... she likely won't act out... hopefully..."
  gts_sonxi.3.a: "Can we contact her?"
  gts_sonxi.3.b: "Let her continue to sleep..."
  gts_sonxi.3.b.tooltip: "§RYou sense this may have severe consequences in a decade!§!"
  gts_sonxi.3.c: "Find a way to destroy her!"
  gts_sonxi.3.c.tooltip: "§RYou sense this may have severe consequences!§!"
  gts_sonxi.4.name: "Awaken"
  gts_sonxi.4.desc: "Our scientists tried many ways to communicate with this giant bear girl. Despite numerous setbacks, our efforts were not in vain. As her blue eyes focused on a planet, the entire civilization shuddered.\n\nNonchalantly stepping on a crust that had been devoured clean by her breath, this beastly giantess shook her furry bear ears, rubbed her sleepy eyes, and easily crushed the juiceless planet in her casual waking movements.\n\nThe entire nation watched this giantess's next act. How will she treat our colonies? Will she engage in amicable communication or squash them within her hand?\n\nBut... the rumbling thunder in her stomach answered this question, as she yawned, her fingers moving through the galaxy, randomly picking something up to place into her mouth. And so, our entire empire watched as the stellar girl devoured the entire planet, pink tongue swirling amidst pearly teeth, the poor planet becoming her snack amidst crunching noises, finally disappearing forever in her bottomless throat with a gulp.\n\nNow, unsatisfied, she claps her hands and sets her gaze on our planet..."
  gts_sonxi.4.a: "What on earth is she?"
  gts_sonxi.6.name: "Departure"
  gts_sonxi.6.desc: "Perhaps communicating with her was the right choice for us tinies, but we can't turn back now.\n\nIt seems the giantess's slumber wasn't eternal, but their stellar time spans are beyond our understanding. That day, as people went about their everyday jobs, they caught sight of the perfect bear-eared girl suspended in the cosmos. Suddenly, she let out a moan.\n\nEveryone was stunned, countless signal towers turning toward the girl, broadcasting signals at maximum power, but the newly awakened girl merely rubbed her eyes irritably, shook her ears, and turned away from us.\n\nEverything okay? Or does she have other plans? We can't fathom the giantess's intentions, yet... the \"gurgle gurgle\" from her belly reveals everything...\n\nShe was hungry\nShe was hungry in this galaxy where only we resided!\n\nThe girl reached out her hand, casually scooping a celestial body small enough to be lodged in her teeth. We couldn't see her expression-was it an amused smile? Or disdainful gaze? Or perhaps..."
  gts_sonxi.7.name: "Departure"
  gts_sonxi.7.desc: "Unsheathing an expressionless look, she tossed [gts_sonxi_next_planet_1.GetName] into her mouth like a peanut, as giant teeth closed, her tongue twisted, sticky saliva torn from [gts_sonxi_next_planet_1.GetName], yet held its form, witnessing despair, witnessed destruction, a planet shapeless under saliva finally slid down her throat, marked as a mere snack, only to continue her breakfast.\n\nAfter consuming [gts_sonxi_next_planet_1.GetName], she picked up [gts_sonxi_next_planet_2.GetName], colossal gravity wrenching our space stations, delivering both observer and planet into her mouth. This time, she didn't rush to chew, her tongue playfully balancing a sweet treat at the tip, licking at the planet, transforming every topography-mountains and valleys-equally into a sea of saliva, eroding the food planet, tongue flicking, [gts_sonxi_next_planet_2.GetName] rolling before...\n\n\"Gulp~\"\n\nEveryone gazed at the stellar girl's breakfast, having devoured an entire galaxy, yet not fulfilled... perhaps she chose to spare us, offering an apologetic smile before vanishing into the starry sea..."
  gts_sonxi.7.a: "Oh my god?"
  gts_sonxi.8.name: "Divine Punishment"
  gts_sonxi.8.desc: "Yes, a slumbering giantess within our star system obstructs civilization's growth, her colossal body blocking starlight and interrupting trade routes, leaving us no choice. Restless missiles and lasers indiscriminately bombarded her body; she must be removed!\n\nEvidently, we overestimate our status in the eyes of a celestial giantess.\n\nFollowing days of continuous bombardment, the sleeping bear-eared girl let out an irritated sigh, casually flipping over without warning. Her multi-stellar-sized body crushed our fleet without even a cry, annihilated by a simple movement. She opened her eyes, staring annoyed at our planet, eyeing our civilization.\n\nNo lengthy communication; the disturbed girl reached forward, pinching [gts_sonxi_next_planet_continue.GetName] between her fingers, lifting it to inspect closely, gently kneading our colony as if...\n\n\"Gurgle gurgle...\"\n\nHer stomach growled, marking our end, her temporary hunger sentencing [gts_sonxi_next_planet_continue.GetName].\n\nThe ruling tinge-eyed gaze departs, only to be replaced by a pink wet cavern-our colony to be breakfast!"
  gts_sonxi.9.name: "Divine Punishment"
  gts_sonxi.9.desc: "Exhaled heat from the girl's mouth replaced our atmosphere; all survivors on [gts_sonxi_next_planet_continue.GetName] smelled the salty odor of girlish mouth desire, despair spreading across the planet, as fleets desperately tried escape, only to be swallowed by her gravity faster than planets, few lucky ones unable to quickly flee because of her pull, just watching this eerie breakfast scene.\n\n\"Crunch!\"\n\nIvory teeth clashed, biting [gts_sonxi_next_planet_continue.GetName] in half, molten core oozing like molten chocolate, devoured by saliva into crispy shards, pulverized by her agile tongue, slashed into breakfast flavoring, the lip sealed, cutting emergency signals from half-colony, the last image, a closing entrance diminishing into a dark, wet maw, with giant tongue's reach towards us.\n\n\"Crunch~ crunch~\"\n\nShe squinted through her glasses, leisurely sampling colonies and us, her people. Maybe too hungry, or our colony barely sufficing a gap. The bear-eared girl chewed lightly; her throat shifted shortly after when sticky, slippery, despairing...\n\n\"Gulp~\"\n\nLicking her lips, she now eyed the captive remaining half of the colony..."
  gts_sonxi.9.a: "Save us"
  gts_sonxi.10.name: "A Full Meal?"
  gts_sonxi.10.desc: "Without hesitation, the enormous bear-eared girl tossed the remaining half of the planet into her mouth, resentment shadowed in her teeth crashing onto [gts_sonxi_next_planet_continue.GetName].\n\n\"Crunch~ crunch~\"\n\nEarth crumbling! Teeth like stars easily grinding crust, rivers, mountains mingled evenly in her chew, cities engulfed by her greedy tongue and swallowed, death tolls skyrocketing from thousands, to millions, billions-lives swallowed, chewed, gulped, disappeared into her hungry stomach.\n\n\"Glu~glu~\"\n\nMinuscule lives are breakfast-bound for giants, endless structures rolling down her moist esophagus, squeezed relentlessly along with survivors escaping chew, dissolving into an acid ocean, swirling waves inside a pulsating stomach craving for incoming food, monumental waves eclipsing planetary tsunamis in scale, grandeur, and destruction. Some see small islands floating, dissolving in acid-remnants of the other half planet digested nearly entirely in minutes."
  gts_sonxi.11.name: "A Full Meal?"
  gts_sonxi.11.desc: "Stomach acids roiled, tide rose and fell; skeletons remained where waves touched land, eroded, only hard-to-digest rocks persisted with airy hiss showing even stubborn material lasted mere seconds in her stomach.\n\nMinutes later, the deathly churned hell faded, leaving billions of soul's remains in acidic assimilation.\n\nAbsurdly, our tests showed her nutritional intake from our colony, post-breakfast, didn't replenish her wakeful energy.\n\nNow... her sight fell upon the star system, glasses masking greedy eyes scanning our star system, our civilization..."
  gts_sonxi.11.a: "What exactly did you eat?"
  gts_sonxi.11.b: "Please, stop eating!"
  # Subsequent Song Xi Event
  gts_sonxi.100.name: "Leader's Little Fun?"
  gts_sonxi.100.desc: "Although everyone in [root.GetName] acknowledges Leader Song Xi is among those who consume tinies the most, a respectable leader can have some minor hobbies.\n\nLately, [root.GetName] citizens noticed Song Xi unsatisfied merely toying with regular tinies, casting her eyes on other leaders. Leaders smaller than her titanic stature often abducted as party playthings, even leaders her size diminishing under her trickery. Apologies afterward seemed insincere, causing even giantess leaders to voice displeasure."
  gts_sonxi.100.a: "It's intolerable to prey on giant peers!"
  gts_sonxi.100.b: "These are matters among leaders. They'll sort it themselves."
  gts_sonxi.100.c: "Maybe we can make it more enjoyable for everyone...?"
  gts_sonxi.110.name: "New Cosmic Understanding"
  gts_sonxi.110.desc: "Previously, scientists hypothesized an unseen, intangible substance dominated 70% of the universe's mass! Research progressed slowly for over a century, but interacting with these celestial giantesses has revolutionized understanding of cosmic composition. The latest studies reveal it's not dark matter filling the universe but Song Xi's fluids, implying our planet merely floats in her secretion sea..."
  gts_sonxi.110.a: "It's her love juices!"
  gts_sonxi.110.b: "It's her cum!"

  gts_sonxi.110.c: "It's her urine!"
