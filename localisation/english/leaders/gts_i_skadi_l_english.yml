  # Stage Play
  gts_skadi_potral.02.name: "Vast and Barren World"
  gts_skadi_potral.02.desc: "The investigation team successfully passed through the portal, arriving on a vast white land. No similar environment can be found in all the records of our civilization. Everyone cheered at the discovery of a new world and began building a camp to explore. The atmosphere here is filled with an intense floral fragrance that is soothing and pleasant. This fragrance comes from the white minerals that are ubiquitous in this world. These minerals seem to be the only substance in this world. Scientists have analyzed them and were amazed to discover that the majority of their composition is protein, yet their hardness rivals even the armor of our starships.\n\nDuring the investigation, the land suddenly began to experience intense earthquakes without warning. Our investigation team urgently returned through the portal, which closed itself after the fleet passed through. Due to the closure of the portal, scientists could only conclude with disappointment: that it was a flat world made of white wilderness and void. Though regrettable, the white minerals we mined during that time can be processed for use in construction."

  gts_skadi_potral.03.name: "Damaged Stele"
  gts_skadi_potral.03.desc: "The portal opened again. This time our investigation team landed on a coastline. The most striking feature of the coast is a damaged stele. As if sensing the presence of the investigation team, images began to appear on the stele:\n\n\n\nA girl carrying a life-sized greatsword walked toward the depths of the ocean...\nA girl sat on a reef, playing a harp, and the sky began to turn dark...\nA girl whispered a chant, and a group of strange fish-like creatures surrounded her...\nA girl walked towards the land, her massive body smashing a lighthouse that barely came up to her ankles...\nA girl marched forward under fire, mercilessly crushing the army under her feet...\n\n\n\nThe main subject of these images is undoubtedly the same girl. To understand the girl's identity and the meaning of these images, our investigation team immediately sent the footage to the capital for research. Meanwhile, the stele continues to play more images..."

  gts_skadi_potral.03a: "Something extraordinary is about to happen."
  gts_skadi_potral.04.name: "Cataclysm"
  gts_skadi_potral.04.desc: "The sky is dim, and heavy rain is incessantly hitting the ground. People mechanically numbly move forward, allowing the raindrops to hit their bodies. Their expressions are devoid of emotion, their forms resembling a group of slowly crawling ants. Their destination is the last city of humanity.\n\nSince the descent of a being called Ishar-mla, the Great Silence has rapidly begun to invade and devour the entire human civilization. Aegir, a city located in the ocean with advanced technology, was the first to be destroyed by Ishar-mla. Ishar-mla first used her legs to crush the entire city, slowly applying pressure to compress the structures squeezed between her thighs. The high-rise buildings that represent the pinnacle of human technological achievement could not withstand such pressure, and they were crumbled into the seabed along with the tiny humans within. After ensuring no survivors, Ishar-mla landed on the coast of Iberia. This already shattered nation was pulverized under Ishar-mla's giant feet. \n\nThe combined forces of the Kazimierz Grand Knight Order and the Laterano Gold Law Guard launched a fierce attack on this behemoth. Though they didn't topple Ishar-mla, they still caught her attention. Ishar-mla slowly squatted, a slight movement creating a hurricane that blew the formation into disarray. She reached out two jade-like fingers and dug up the cities surrounding the formation, lifting them to her face, opened her lips to reveal a dark, moist, red cavern - the place of Ishar-mla's feeding, and the final resting place of them all; the bloody, tongue was like an unstoppable wall pressing down being the last sight they saw. The Emperor's Blade - a defensive line of structures created at great cost, successfully held off Ishar-mla from Usas's land, but Ishar-mla, quickly adapting to demonic power, absorbed the entire nation as her body grew larger in the midst of explosions. The size of the nation, which would have taken her a long time to trample, is now not as large as a bed to her.\n\nColumbia, Sami, Yan, and the remnants of other nations have gathered together to form humanity's last line of defense, and with the help of a leader named Kal'tsit, they built humanity's last city."

  gts_skadi_potral.04a: "Disturbing."
  gts_skadi_potral.05.name: "The Final Stand"
  gts_skadi_potral.05.desc: "Kal'tsit stood on the high wall, looking at the lines of refugees stretching to the horizon. The frown on her face never softened. Kal'tsit knows that with Ishar-mla's size now, this world will be turned upside down in a single day, and it is a certainty that they will be discovered.\n\nThe ground started to tremble with a deafening roar, and the buildings within the city began to collapse. She has arrived. Kal'tsit jumped from the high wall, grabbed the hand of the person called 'Doctor' next to her, and walked toward the deepest part of the fortress. §G 'Doctor... Do not worry about us, this is our fate.’§! Kal'tsit activated the device on the doctor’s body. §G'Mon3tr and I will protect everyone, especially you, Doctor.'§! Originium Arts took effect, and the Doctor felt their blood boiling. After a flash of light, the doctor has vanished, leaving behind only a stone coffin, and the universe inside it. §G'May you remain clear-minded even in your dreams.'§!\n\nThe situation outside has already descended into chaos. A blood-red eye occupied the entire sky. Kal'tsit had barely stepped out of the fortress when the blood-red eye locked onto her. Kal'tsit stared the eye in the sky. A huge wave of pressure crawled up her spine. §B'Kal'tsit, what have you done to the Doctor? I can see everything.’§! The voice was deafening, and people on the ground screamed, blood oozing from their ears. §G'You won't get what you want here, you monster.'§! Kal'tsit was unwilling to give in. She had already prepared to sacrifice her near-eternal life. §B 'Tsk, it seems that you ants have no value in coexisting. Then you shall be obliterated.'§! The blood-red eye retreated, replaced by a sky-obscuring, pink flesh wall, which was rapidly approaching the ground.\n\n\nThe stele's images abruptly ended, and the portal behind the investigation team suddenly closed. 'Oh my god, look at the sky! That blood-red - eye -' Our communication with the investigation team was completely cut off."

  gts_skadi_meet.01.desc: "Our fleet passed through the portal, and what we saw was the white-haired girl from the stele's images: with a normal human-sized body, she floated on the surface of the sea, softly singing a nameless, sorrowful song. The girl noticed our arrival, and her song ended abruptly. She lifted her head and 'looked' at the flagship command room several kilometers above, or rather... at you. §B'Doctor...'§! The girl's expression finally changed slightly. So far, she has not shown any hostility, and it seems that she has something to tell us."

I have been searching for so long, for too long. But none of that matters anymore, it's not so important anymore...'§! The girl's tone became increasingly euphoric, as if she would pounce at any moment."
  skadi_answer01: "Who are you?"
  skadi_answer01a: "The girl's expression became puzzled. §B 'Doctor, don't you remember me?'§! After thinking for a while, the girl replied: §B'My name is Skadi, a former operative under your command.'§!"

  skadi_answer06: "Peer into the girl's thoughts"
  skadi_answer06a: "Although this girl's psionic power is so strong that she can create colossal waves in the Shroud, you easily read her thoughts. She isn't lying. Her thoughts are pure and, even... docile."

  skadi_answer666: "We can accept you, but..."
  gts_skadi_potral.07.name: "Invitation"

  gts_skadi_potral.07.desc: "We ran a full body scan on Skadi and discovered that her physiological structure is almost identical to our species. Part of the gene sequence we extracted closely matches that of the missing exploration team... At the same time, her cell activity and differentiation potential are far beyond ours. During several stress tests, she demonstrated amazing adaptability. Moreover, it's not passive adaptation but active selection of adaptation direction. In a sense, she can reshape her form according to her own will - no biological technology can do that.\n\nAs for the song Skadi performs, it can affect reality within both the material universe and the astral plane. If she were to serve us, her performance on the battlefield could enhance our fleets and weaken the enemy's forces.\n\nHowever, the sheer size of Skadi's true form is too vast. Even the slightest movements from her can cause disasters of cataclysmic proportions. We must make her withdraw from our world.\n\nNow, Skadi stands quietly, waiting on your instructions."
  gts_skadi_potral.07a: "Assign her to Navy Command."
  gts_skadi_potral.07b: "Use shrinking hormones on her."
  gts_skadi_traits.99.name: ""
  gts_skadi_traits.99.desc: "According to reports, there are large areas of abandoned city districts on a colonized planet within our empire. Collapsed buildings and facilities occupying large amounts of space have made construction on this planet difficult. Therefore, we have decided to send a giantess to solve this problem in a simple and brutal manner and reclaim those resources. And the most suitable candidate for this task is none other than Skadi.\n\n§BThis is... my target? How tedious...§!\n\nThe Orca girl stepped heavily beside a small city district, coldly staring at a small patch of gray urban area lying against the inner side of her bare foot. Considering Skadi's enormous true form, if she were to step directly on this planet, the entire planet would probably be crushed into Skadi's footprints in an instant. Therefore, we have pre-injected Skadi with a small amount of reversible shrinking hormones to adjust her to a suitable size. But even so, even just Skadi's forefoot is much larger than a city district that could accommodate hundreds of millions of small people. Or rather, Skadi's toes are already large enough to be 'city districts' for the small people.\n\n§BOnly need one step, right?§!\n\nThe girl's voice sentenced the carpet-like city under her giant foot. A mountain-like foot rose from the ground, and Skadi controlled the sky-obscuring sole to slowly hover above the city. The gust of wind generated by the girl lifting her foot has already destroyed large swathes of the city's outskirts. Her towering jade foot, enshrouded in clouds, covered the sky above the city. The city, shrouded in the shadow cast by Skadi's sole, had plunged into darkness. Perhaps the few rays of light that seeped through the gaps in the girl's toes were the greatest kindness that Skadi could bestow on the small city.\n\n§BHmph... well, goodbye then.§!\n\nThe meat-colored sky slowly but firmly crushed down, and the giant wall called a foot gradually rolled down towards the city. Once prosperous structures offered little resistance under the meat wall of the girl's foot, crushed into dust the instant they made contact with her skin. Only a few lucky buildings were fortunate enough to be spared Skadi's wrath. Snagged in the wrinkles beneath her foot, they escaped being turned into a pile of rubble. Then, scarcely a fraction of a second later, Skadi's sole had completely made contact with the fragmented earth. The gap between her foot and the ground disappeared under the girl's weight. This city district, as we planned, had become dust under Skadi's foot. However, despite the desperate scenes within the city, Skadi felt not even a sliver of stimulation from the moment she lifted her foot to the moment she crushed it entirely.\n\n§BFinished? Oh well. I was planning to destroy this planet once the shrinking hormones’ effect wore off...§!\n\nAlthough Skadi’s last words caused the other inhabitants of this planet to feel apprehensive, we still successfully found what we needed in the continent-sized footprint Skadi left behind."
  gts_skadi_traits.99a: "Extract alloys from Skadi's footprint."
  gts_skadi_traits.99b: "It's enough to extract the resources left in Skadi's toe crevices."
  gts_skadi_traits.99c: "§BClean my foot? Okay...§!"
  gts_skadi_potral.09.name: "Shrinking Successful"
  gts_skadi_potral.09.desc: "Success! After releasing all the shrinking hormones in our armory into Skadi's toes, Skadi's cell receptors recognized and bound to them, which induced self-shrinking while continuously producing and secreting new hormones that acted on the surrounding cells. This cascading reaction caused Skadi's body to shrink rapidly, and the drastic changes in size even caused a collapse. Fortunately, Skadi cast a psionic barrier, so our fleet could observe this spectacle without being crushed. How long it’s been, or how many galaxies it destroyed, is unknown, but our galaxy can finally contain Skadi's entire body.\n\nSurely, such a large giantess can easily devour invading fleets and tear apart stars. What should we do with Skadi’s true form next?"
  gts_skadi_potral.09a: "Shrink her further and send her to my bed."
  gts_skadi_potral.10.name: "Orca Descent"
  gts_skadi_potral.10.desc: "A strange spatial distortion phenomenon has appeared over our capital [Root.Capital.GetName]. The distortion gradually grew larger, becoming a giant portal, and something from the other side is about to emerge.\n\nFirst to appear were a pair of feet. Each foot is more than 20,000 kilometers in length, and just the instep alone could support our entire capital! The owner of these feet is Skadi, a giantess with 100 million times our size. Although shrinking hormones can indeed turn world-destroying giantesses into less-than-grain-of-sand entities, it seems that Skadi's original size was too colossal. 100 million times larger is close to the limit. And now Skadi, who almost covers the entire sky of our planet, is falling directly on our capital. Like hundreds of giant meteorites crashing down, the entire crust was shattered by Skadi's impact. The continents were torn apart and flung into space by the intense impact. The ocean evaporated instantly. The inhabitants were directly reduced to blood foam in the shockwave and the planet's core emitted a deathly, furious roar. \n\nSkadi felt the loss of large amounts of life around her and stabilized the core of the planet, preventing further destruction. But, after the impact, the entire planet was already devastated."
  gts_skadi_potral.10a: "Claim it was an invasion by a Star God Beast."

  gts_skadi_potral.11.name: "Dangerous Experiment"
  gts_skadi_potral.11.desc: "The ability of shrinking hormones to shrink personnel, cities and even planets has been a success in war and humiliating giantesses, but now a large batch in our armory is about to decompose. To put these hormones to good use, scientists propose to apply them to Skadi’s true form to obtain valuable research data. Although this proposition is exceptionally unreasonable, opportunities to shrink a universe-level giantess are rare, should we try it?"

The two maidens' cherry lips gradually drew together, easily accommodating entire stars worth of tongue, tightly entwining with each other, while [Owner.Capital.GetName] was unfortunately caught in the middle, its inhabitants only able to see the ever-shifting pink sky. Gurgle, gurgle, the turbulent ocean of saliva constantly battered the psionic barrier. If the barrier were to break, the entire planet would be flooded by the massive amount of saliva raining down from the sky, and billions would drown. Everyone could only pray silently, hoping the pink beasts above would leave soon, hoping that this farce would end quickly. As if savoring the fear of the people, the battle between the titan maidens' tongues intensified, the rate of change and fluctuations of the sky became more violent, the barriers on the planet's surface started to deform and crack.

  gts_skadi_traits.00.desc: "We gathered food transport ships from several planets in space. The food on board could feed all the citizens of our capital for three years, but now it is merely being served as an afternoon snack on the giantess’s dining table.\n\nSkadi, with her titan-like body, gracefully swam up to the fleet. Before the transport ships could unload the food, Skadi stretched out her giant hand and easily grasped a ship. The ship's armor began to distort and break under the immense pressure, but Skadi showed no sign of stopping. With a bit of force, she tore open the cargo hold at the rear. She opened her cherry lips and extended her gigantic tongue, effortlessly sweeping in all food and crew members, becoming Skadi’s nourishment. Soon all the ships were devoured by Skadi's gluttony, but her hunger didn't seem to be satisfied. Her bloodshot eyes quickly locked onto innocent passing ships... \n\nFortunately, our military reacted quickly. By concentrating attacks on the weak spots of Skadi's armor between her legs, we successfully restored her sanity. However, many of those who were eager to see the Orca up close forever disappeared into Skadi's mouth. Although the incident caused temporary chaos, most people were moved by Skadi’s cute eating scene."

After all, this behavior is completely instinctual. However, we can use Skadi's predatory habits and hunting skills to deal with threats to the empire, such as pirates and smugglers who harass our borders.

  gts_skadi_traits.03.desc: "Our sensors detected a giant lifeform appearing outside our empire. It was our commander Skadi who had been missing for a month. She is.. satisfying her desires with a planet inhabited by a primitive civilization. On the inner side of Skadi's thighs, some viscous fluid is already flowing from the two lips, which are already desperate for the touch.\n\nThe natives on the planet looked up at the sky, watching the giant face. Governments began to hold emergency meetings, religious groups were vigorously propagating the descent of the gods, and military institutions were deploying their strongest weapons to defend their homes. But all this was incomprehensible to Skadi.\n\nAfter placing a psionic barrier around the planet, Skadi’s slender finger, which was thousands of kilometers long and like another planet, pressed against the southern hemisphere. She slowly pushed the planet into her moistened entrance, starting this planetary-scale intercourse. The barrier of the northern hemisphere was the first to contact the cavity wall, but could not withstand the pressure and shattered. The polar ice caps, which hadn’t melted for hundreds of millions of years, came into contact with cavity wall without any buffer. Skadi, experiencing this cold sensation for the first time, couldn’t resist the pleasure and immediately slammed the entire planet into her cavity. The powerful internal pressure constantly squeezed and challenged the planet's surface barrier. Many areas on the planet experienced cracks in the barriers. Driven by pleasure, Skadi increased the friction within the cavity. One moment the planet is deep in the cavity and another it is almost pulled outside before slamming back into the cervix. The speed at which the planet is inserted and pulled increases. The cavity’s pressure on the barrier is continuously increased. The barrier continues to wail. The small people continue to flee. The fluids continue to flow.\n\nFinally, the barrier shattered. Skadi’s barrier ultimately could no longer withstand its internal pressure, and the disorderly screams on the planet disappeared. Huge walls of fleshy cavity enveloped the entire planet, devouring everything on its surface. Whether it was mountains or deep seas, they were all equally compressed into a flat surface by the cavity wall. Skadi’s body, experiencing such unprecedented pleasure, erupted with tremendous power. In a brief moment, the planet, after being crushed by the pressure deep within the cavity, was ejected with large amounts of debris and fluids. The resulting mixture shattered the planet's pathetic moon. Skadi, her cheeks flushed, breathed heavily. She slowly withdrew her fingers, laced with strands of sticky fluid, and looked down at the mess beneath her..."

In a battle, she swallowed an enemy Greater Daemon and combined the Shroud's psionic energy with the fleet’s armor in a distorted manner.\n\nThis newly made armor can react when enemy psionic attacks arrive, creating localized psionic bursts that deflect the attack.

Our scientists have also transcribed a song about the golden age of the Iberian Golden Fleet - §HFool's Tune§!. However, we had no way to sing this song. Just as everyone was at a loss, someone suggested letting Skadi, who is from the Terra civilization, give it a try. Skadi was initially reluctant but after hesitating, a melodious song floated from her lips.\n\n§BThe dawn heralds the surge of the sea. Even though time passes, the faith will not be forgotten.§!\n\nThose present who heard the song were filled with passion.  They were eager to board a warship and head to a battlefield filled with blood and glory.\n\n§BFriends, we must contend with the storm until the golden age returns.§!\n\nThe song ended.

The first half of the plan went smoothly. Skadi didn't notice the drugs mixed in the food. But perhaps her body's defense mechanism kicked in. Skadi's body began to grow larger, destroying all the buildings and facilities along the way. The growth stopped when she reached 200 times her original size. And then the drugs took effect. Skadi fell to the ground and fell asleep peacefully...\n\nUsing growth to dilute absorbed poisons, this defense mechanism is not common.

Just like two planets collided, this set off a cataclysm of an unprecedented scale, and the first casualties appeared. Due to the suddenness of the event, the personnel and facilities on [Root.GetName] had not been transferred. Dozens of densely populated cities were directly crushed far underneath the surface.

Now, §Y[event_target:gtsra_random_planet_resist.GetName]§! is only the size of a fitness ball to her. Completely ignoring the gaze of the insects on the planet, the futanari giantess took off her short skirt, and her already aroused meat rod, more than 80 million meters long, was revealed. Massive amounts of blood were continuously pumped through the blood vessels whose surface radius exceeded thousands of meters, making the engorged meat rod hot and red. The surrounding fleet and the anti-aircraft fire on the planet rapidly launched a fierce attack on the appeared threat. Explosions of varying magnitudes occurred on the futanari’s glans. Their power was enough to make stars explode and satellites shatter, but could only give the futanari a slight stimulation, causing more pre-cum to secrete from her head.\n\n‘Hmph, is this the strongest firepower of you trash?’ Although she mocked them verbally, the futanari was excited after witnessing the fruitless resistance from the civilization.
