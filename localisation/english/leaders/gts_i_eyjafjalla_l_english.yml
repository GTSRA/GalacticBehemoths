  d_gts_eyjafjalla: "\"Mother of Volcanoes\""
  d_gts_eyjafjalla_desc: "A fitting nickname given by the locals to this giant volcano located in the center of the planet.\nAlthough geological surveys indicate that its state is relatively stable, we still need to make many preparations if we really intend to explore inside."
  d_gts_eyjafjalla_vore: "\"Belly of the Volcano\""
  d_gts_eyjafjalla_vore_desc: "Who would have thought that beneath this giant volcano would be a warm and soft underground hot spring? In any case, this unexpected gain further stimulated tourism on the entire planet. Nowadays, sightseeing on the surface and vacationing underground have become the most popular options for this planet."
  d_gts_eyjafjalla_pit: "Eyjafjalla Grand Canyon"
  d_gts_eyjafjalla_pit_desc: "After Eyjafjalla left this planet, the huge space that her body originally occupied, the wide basins left by her buttocks and feet are now especially regarded as \"the mark of the current giantess scientist\" and have become a new hot tourist spot.\nAfter losing Eyjafjalla as an energy source, the volcanic activity of the entire planet has gradually stabilized to a level where the local residents can live in peace."
  d_eyjafjalla_milk_sea: "Milk Inner Sea"

  d_eyjafjalla_milk_sea_desc: "The inner sea formed by the milk that Eyjafjalla squeezed out above her home planet to relieve her engorgement. This place, once a desolate sand sea, has now become a holy land for farming and tourism, with new ecosystems forming in Eyjafjalla's milk."
  GTS_CURE_EYJAFJALLA: "Cure Eyjafjalla"

  GTS_CURE_EYJAFJALLA_DESC: "In order to heal Miss Eyjafjalla, the Imperial Medical Department, using our latest examination equipment, will locate the lesions in her body. Subsequently, coordinating with the Engineering Department and the Science Department, thousands of small person agents will be dispatched to enter Eyjafjalla's body through the ear canals, mouth, and intestines to search for and remove the Originium remnants within her."

  gts_eyjafjalla_category_desc: "There is an astonishing number of volcanoes on this planet."
  gts_eyjafjalla.26.name: "Volcanic Star"
  gts_eyjafjalla.26.desc: "Scans indicate that there is a huge energy source beneath this planet-an energy source that clearly could not have been naturally generated by this medium-sized planet. It constantly emits large amounts of energy to the surrounding areas, and this energy, with nowhere to be released, did not destroy the planet, but instead under the guidance of some unnatural force, it erupted from various thinner areas of the surface, it has formed the magnificent volcanic landscape on this planet.\n\nOur science officer also pointed out that, given this planet's abundant geothermal energy, once we can stabilize the planet and cause its climate to recover, it is expected that this planet will be transformed into a thriving and warm world in a short period of time. However, concrete plans will still need to wait until after we decide to settle on this planet for further research."

  gts_star_volcano_desc: "The wondrous volcanic landscape of this planet attracts tourists from all over the Empire, though it's another story for the residents who live here."
  gts_egg.1.name: "Successful Excavation"
  gts_egg.1.desc: "We have successfully completed this phase of excavation, and now more underground districts are available for us to build. During the excavation, we unexpectedly discovered many precious cultural relics. After identification, these precious relics came from many mysteriously vanished cities and civilizations in history. Some relics even came from ultra-ancient life that has never been recorded. These findings have greatly influenced our society."
  gts_egg.1.a: "What other secrets does this planet hold?"
  gts_egg.2.name: "Successful Excavation"
  gts_egg.2.desc: "We have successfully completed this phase of excavation, and now more underground districts are available for us to build. During this time, the new technologies developed by our scientists for safe excavation, as well as our new discoveries during the inward excavation, have brought a lot of inspiration to our current scientific research."
  gts_egg.2.a: "Well done!"
  gts_egg.3.name: "Excavation Accident"
  gts_egg.3.desc: "We have completed this phase of excavation, and now more underground districts are available for construction. Unfortunately, due to insufficient assessment of the environmental risks of this development and a series of errors in actual operation, our Egg Home Planet instantly devoured a large number of urban areas and millions of people in the city."
  gts_egg.3.a: "What a disaster!"
  gts_egg.4.name: "Development Completed"
  gts_egg.4.desc: "We have successfully completed all the excavation work, and the core of our home planet is specially protected at a safe distance.\nThis unique and enormous planet has been completely understood by us, and its infinite potential will be used by us."
  gts_egg.4.a: "Finally..."
  gts_eyjafjalla.2.name: "Underground Hot Springs"
  gts_eyjafjalla.2.desc: "Our expedition decided to enter from an open cave near the volcano.\nAfter passing through spacious underground caverns, narrow corridors, draped in warm air and slippery ground, our expedition finally reached directly below the volcano.\nContrary to any hypothesis that our scientists had speculated, the inside of the volcano is not directly connected to the crater, and the environment is not extremely hot. Our explorers can even take off their protective suits and move freely inside. The explorers even believe that this underground space is more habitable than the harsh environment on the surface. Apart from some highly corrosive acid on one side of this space, most of the surface is warm and comfortable. The expedition team plans to bring developers on the next exploration trip. If all goes well, perhaps we will get a new tourist attraction?"
  gts_eyjafjalla.2.a: "A gift from the heavens!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.2.b: "I feel like this place is dangerous, we should explore somewhere else."
  gts_eyjafjalla.2.tooltip: "We will enter the volcano from another place."
  gts_eyjafjalla.3.name: "Serene Milk Spring"
  gts_eyjafjalla.3.desc: "Our expedition eventually decided to descend directly into the crater by rope.\nBut it turns out that this volcano is much higher than we thought. After lengthening the ropes several times, the explorers successfully landed, and on the soft ground were several smaller caves with complex paths resembling a maze.\nAfter several days, the explorers found the core of this volcano - a sea of warm milk. Could this really be the core of this giant volcano? Our explorers cannot believe it.\nNow they have proposed some rather radical solutions, such as pinpoint blasting, to look for the real core downwards."
  gts_eyjafjalla.3.a: "Then why not give it a try?" #detonate
  gts_eyjafjalla.4.name: "Profound Chrysanthemum Cave"
  gts_eyjafjalla.4.desc: "Our expedition decided to enter from a remote cave far from the volcano.\nApart from the sticky liquid everywhere, the cave was wider and cleaner than we imagined, but the deeper we went, the more we could sense a strange odor. And when we reached the end of the road, we saw a huge obstacle like a small celestial body, spherical, rubbery, and seemed to be printed with a heart?\nThis huge creation, like a giantess's dildo, perfectly blocked our attempt to drill through, and judging from the size of this dildo, there will probably be something even more unimaginable behind it."
  gts_eyjafjalla.4.a: "Find a way to blast a path!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.5.name: "Volcanic Eruption!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.5.desc: "As planned, a large number of shaped explosives were deployed around the core of the volcano. The button was activated, but only a slight tremor came from the bottom of the volcano, and these explosives failed to blow out any holes. Just as the expedition began to suspect that there were not enough explosives loaded, the milky sea in the core of the volcano suddenly surged in a very short period of time, and then massive amounts of extremely hot milk were sprayed out of all the openings. This volcano erupted. And as if all this wasn't terrible enough, after a massive earthquake across a wide area, the volcano, along with the surrounding mountains, collapsed with a roar, and a huge figure rose from the dust-filled sky. It turns out that this huge volcano was connected to the chest of a sleeping giantess!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.5.a: "Immediately connect to the communication panel!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.6.name: "Volcanic Eruption!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.6.desc: "As planned, a large amount of high-energy explosives were deployed around this dildo. Unfortunately, after the detonation, this dildo and the surrounding walls suffered no damage whatsoever. Then the entire cave began to tremble violently. The expedition team quickly escaped from the cave, and then a burst of violent alien natural gas gushed out of the opening, making a very indecent sound. There is no doubt that if the expedition had not been able to evacuate in time, they would have been torn to pieces by this storm. And as if all this wasn't terrible enough, after a massive earthquake across a wide area, the volcano, along with the surrounding mountains, collapsed with a roar, and a huge figure rose from the dust-filled sky. It turns out that this huge volcano was connected to the chest of a sleeping giantess! And the place we explored before was this giantess's...back passage."

One hand is supporting on the ground, while the other hand is tightly covering the position we just stimulated, and sticky liquid seems to be still flowing out of the vaginal opening.\n\n\"You, who are you? Where am I?\""
  gts_eyjafjalla.7.a: "Don't be nervous, we mean no harm"
  gts_eyjafjalla.7.a.response: "No harm? Then why... why did you do that?\n\n(After a long explanation, Eyjafjalla understood the situation)\n\nSo, I'm not on Terra..."
  gts_eyjafjalla.7.b: "Do you know why you are here?"
  gts_eyjafjalla.7.b.response: "No, I have no memory at all... I was in the dormitory then self... anyway, I don't know how I fell asleep, and then I felt your stimulation, then I woke up..."
  gts_eyjafjalla.7.c: "Then what are you planning to do next?"
  gts_eyjafjalla.7.c.response: "Hmm...\nSince you are the ones who woke me up, I have no choice but to join you for the time being. My geology knowledge can help you with terrain surveys, although it seems your world is much smaller than ours...\nAnd then I plan to explore this universe.\n\n(As she said this, Eyjafjalla looked a little excited, which reminded you that she said their society was still in the pre-space era when she talked about her home planet)\n\nWell, if I can find my home planet, I'll make other decisions then."

  gts_eyjafjalla.8.desc: "The close medical team has completed a long-range genetic diagnosis of Miss Eyjafjalla. According to the diagnostic report, although there are no records of this disease in any galaxy, with the help of modern medicine, there is a high chance that the \"incurable disease\" in her words can be cured. Due to Eyjafjalla's lovely personality and good reputation in the empire, the Imperial Medical Department has received countless applications from top physicians and volunteers hoping to participate in the surgery to cure Miss Eyjafjalla."
  gts_eyjafjalla.8.a: "Prepare for surgery immediately!"

  gts_eyjafjalla.101.name: "Investigation Accident"
  gts_eyjafjalla.101.desc: "A dejected Eyjafjalla sent us a communication. After comforting her for a while, we understood what had happened.\nWhen investigating an uninhabited planet, Eyjafjalla, who had been staying up late too much, accidentally slipped on the glacier at the planet's polar region and heavily landed deep into the fragile planet. When she tried to struggle to her feet, the planet, which had already been severely impacted, could not withstand her strength and rapidly disintegrated. Although Miss Eyjafjalla herself was fine, she was still very sad about the fact that an entire naturally formed planet had been destroyed by her.\nNow engineering drones have been dispatched to Miss Eyjafjalla's skirt and under her buttocks to recover usable planet fragments. From the feedback data, the rocks attached to Eyjafjalla have been transformed into a hard substance like alloy due to her great power, and other dust has also condensed into high-quality minerals. Perhaps Miss Eyjafjalla's potential in other areas is unexpectedly high?\nOf course, considering that she is so guilty just for accidentally destroying a planet, to avoid upsetting her, it is better if we do not do that."

  gts_eyjafjalla.110.name: "Engorgement"
  gts_eyjafjalla.110.desc: "Eyjafjalla told our medical team a few days ago that her breasts were a bit sore and swollen.\nAfter a comprehensive investigation, the medical team was surprised to find that Eyjafjalla was engorged! We are certain that Miss Eyjafjalla has no pregnancy experience, but the fact is indeed the case. Perhaps it is due to their species characteristics or the aftermath of Oripathy recovery.\nThe immediate priority now is to deal with the milk in Eyjafjalla's breasts. Even if conservatively estimated, one spray of milk from Miss Eyjafjalla would be enough to form an inland sea on our home planet."
  gts_eyjafjalla.110.a: "Find a black hole and let Eyjafjalla handle it herself"
  gts_eyjafjalla.110.b: "Let the engineering department help Eyjafjalla with it"
  gts_eyjafjalla.110.c: "Inland sea? Our planet just happens to have such a modification plan!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.111.desc: "We have received another report of engorgement from Miss Eyjafjalla.\nNow that we are well prepared to deal with Miss Eyjafjalla's massive sprays of milk, but Miss Eyjafjalla has also stated that she can go to an uninhabited star system to solve the problem herself without troubling us."
  gts_eyjafjalla.112.name: "White Hole"
  gts_eyjafjalla.112.desc: "We found a secluded black hole system and issued a supraluminal traffic ban. All security fleets are stationed at each jump point in and out of the system to ensure that Miss Eyjafjalla's milk extraction is not peeped at by malicious people.\n\nSoon after, our patrol fleets detected a strong gravitational fluctuation from the direction of the black hole. When the fleet arrived, they only saw Eyjafjalla with her upper body naked, her face flushed, and milk droplets still dripping from her nipples, as well as the black hole briefly turning white.\n\nAccording to Eyjafjalla's own description, she was attracted by the gravity of the black hole when squeezing milk facing it, and couldn't help but put her nipple into the black hole for...nursing. However, even the black hole could not handle that much milk in the face of the sexually aroused Eyjafjalla, so it sprayed out strong gravitational fluctuations, which made Eyjafjalla sober up.\n\nIn any case, Eyjafjalla has temporarily solved her engorgement problem, and our research ship has also collected very valuable research data."
  gts_eyjafjalla.112.a: "Great!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.113.name: "Can't Wait!"
  gts_eyjafjalla.113.desc: "The solution given by the engineering department was very simple and crude: directly extract milk from Eyjafjalla's nipples until it's all drained.\n\nBut this method is obviously inefficient. In the following weeks, whether Eyjafjalla was working, eating, or sleeping, she had to keep her clothes up exposing her upper breasts for the transport fleet to dock, load a large can of milk that had been extracted, and then transport it to the Imperial warehouse. On one hand, Eyjafjalla had to suppress her desire to spray out milk, and on the other hand, she had to endure the shame of showing her breasts to the endless stream of transport teams who were constantly going to the empire, while also enduring the near-nothing itching caused by the water extraction machine at her nipples.\n\nIn the end, when she heard that the processing work was only halfway done, she couldn't accept it any longer and escaped to the center of the galaxy, where she began to squeeze her breasts in a self-destructive manner towards the star, while crying.\n\nWhen she calmed down, she sincerely apologized to the engineering department. As compensation, the milk extracted from Eyjafjalla that was in the imperial warehouse was directly given to us.\n\nOf course, she strongly demanded that the engineering department must improve their processing solutions in the future.\n\nThe engineering department will of course listen to her suggestions."
  gts_eyjafjalla.114.name: "Inland Sea"
  gts_eyjafjalla.114.desc: "It was too crazy to pour milk from breasts on the surface of our home planet, and Miss Eyjafjalla barely agreed to it after a lot of persuasion from us.\n\nThe planned location for milk spraying was a tropical desert in the center of the planet. Before that, we have already relocated the local population and valuable facilities, and those from all over the globe and even the empire who were interested in this event were firmly controlled outside of the several hundred kilometers of the control line.\n\nIn order to make it easier for Eyjafjalla to determine the landing point, the milk spraying was scheduled at night, and tens of thousands of lights would guide Eyjafjalla to calibrate the direction of her nipples.\n\nThe time came, and what was shown in the sky was a shy Eyjafjalla with two hands holding her nipples in front of her chest. Then, as instructed, Eyjafjalla began to rub her breasts, and her shyness gradually turned into enjoyment. She no longer cared about the gaze of billions of tiny insects on the planet beneath her, and concentrated on her self-pleasuring. A few drops of milk first flowed from her nipples, fell into the sky above the planet, and turned into white raindrops and hailstones, falling on the desert that had been arid for tens of millions of years.\n\nThen the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and a white ocean began to form, and when Eyjafjalla reached her climax, a massive amount of milk broke through the barrier of the atmosphere and directly poured into the milk sea. The area of the ocean even exceeded the original prediction. It seems that Eyjafjalla even feels more excited when she is watched while pleasuring herself. Although we evacuated the masses who were in danger due to the rising milk sea, many buildings could only be abandoned and submerged in the ocean left behind by Eyjafjalla's self-pleasuring. For the following months, the entire planet was filled with the smell of milk.\n\nAlthough it was magnificent, it is better if we don't do that again in the future."

  gts_eyjafjalla.200.name: "Eyjafjalla Growth Plan"
  gts_eyjafjalla.200.desc: "Our scientists have completed the geological survey of Eyjafjalla's home planet.\n\nExperimental data shows that the history of [event_target:gts_eyjafjalla_planet.GetName] from its birth to the present is quite short, which is completely inconsistent with the general laws of planetary formation and evolution. The matter of the entire planet was likely formed in a short time by the massive energy released by Eyjafjalla in an instant.\n\nThe most convincing hypothesis at present is probably this: the world where Eyjafjalla once lived was several times larger than our universe. At that time, Eyjafjalla's relative size in our universe was as large as an entire galaxy. And when she accidentally entered this world, the cold and vacuum environment of space made her body instinctively deploy an energy shield.\n\nThe massive loss of energy caused Eyjafjalla to fall into a deep sleep, while her body size shrank to that of a normal Titan Giantess. And this unstable energy fluctuation formed the frequent volcanic activity on this planet.\n\nIn other words, the entire planet was essentially once part of Eyjafjalla's body. If we return this planet back to Eyjafjalla's body, perhaps she can regain the powers she lost before?"

A large number of detectors and cameras have been installed in the empty city clusters to record the planet's environmental changes and internal physiological changes in real-time when Eyjafjalla devours the planet and grows.\n\nIt is said that many of Eyjafjalla's fanatic fans have stayed or smuggled themselves onto this planet, but we no longer have time to find them one by one, so let their wishes be satisfied.\n\nNow, we just need to notify our leading lady and tell her about the way we decided for her to use the planet!"

  gts_eyjafjalla.226.desc: "§r“Then, I'll start, Senior~”§!\n\nAfter receiving our communication, Eyjafjalla, who had been floating quietly in the planet's orbit, gently responded and approached the planet that was about the same size as her current body. Her milky-white skin gradually enveloped the planet's sky, and her pink pupils slowly scanned everything on the land. Whether it was the once prosperous cities or the lush vegetation, in Eyjafjalla's eyes, they were now merely as small and fragile as patches of gray or green moss, as if even a single lick from her would be enough to destroy everything here.\n\n§r“Ah--”§!\n\nA cute voice from the girl resounded throughout the planet. Her lips, which stretched across the sky, trembled slightly and separated towards both sides, revealing the dark red abyss of the girl's “mouth”. A moist and hot breath rushed from the depths of her bottomless throat, and in an instant, it had almost washed over half of the planet's land. Several rainstorms formed by Eyjafjalla's saliva also formed in various parts of the planet. Then, Eyjafjalla gently extended her translucent tongue tip. The soft, pink behemoth pierced straight into the land, grinding hundreds of meters deep of land into a wisp of dust. All resistance from civilization or nature was essentially powerless in the face of such a gigantic tongue. Moving her tongue gently, countless old cities and some small people who volunteered to stay on the land were rolled onto the pink behemoth, scattered among the huge taste buds, and finally fell into the torrent of saliva. Her throat slowly opened, and a layer of the land surface, which was sufficient to last for thousands of years, fell into Eyjafjalla's satellite-sized stomach, gradually turning into a part of Eyjafjalla's body in the viscous and scorching gastric juices."
  gts_eyjafjalla.227.desc: "§r“It seems... I'm indeed getting bigger?”§!\n\nOur plan succeeded unexpectedly. Eyjafjalla's body rapidly expanded with a loud bang after only digesting a small part of the planet, until the planet now was only half the size of Eyjafjalla's body. And our heroine, the somewhat surprised girl, looked around her body and then looked back at the even smaller planet.\n\n§r“Then, let's continue.”§!\n\nEyjafjalla reopened her mouth, and her rosy lips slammed down onto the ground, the moist and hot abyss covering an entire continent of the planet. The earth, which could nurture hundreds of millions of small people, was held in the girl's mouth like a fragile cracker. Then, her huge lips gradually closed, and the entire continent fell powerlessly onto Eyjafjalla's tongue. Ocean-like saliva continuously washed over the small piece of land. Eventually, this land could not escape the fate of being swallowed and digested by Eyjafjalla. Then, Eyjafjalla, whose body had expanded once again, gently clenched her fist, and without any hesitation, she opened her huge mouth, which was already the size of a star gate, and began to rapidly engulf everything on the planet. Whether it was the remaining buildings and small people, or millennia of landforms and the mantle, all were eventually dissolved and utilized in the girl's mouth or stomach. And when Eyjafjalla had become large enough to gently hold all the remaining remnants of the planet in her mouth, she finally returned to her former state: a true celestial-level giantess."
  gts_eyjafjalla.228.name: "Underarm Planet"
  gts_eyjafjalla.228.desc: "After receiving our communication, Eyjafjalla, who was quietly suspended in the sky above the planet, blushed and floated forward, extending her palm, which was as wide as a continent, in an attempt to cover up and half-shyly covered her rosy cheeks. The arm, as magnificent as a towering pillar, slowly rose under the control of the girl's delicate skin, and her tender pink armpit was exposed to the sky above the planet.\n\nThe real-time images from the cameras we had pre-installed on the ground even better illustrated the oppressive feeling brought about by this small action of Eyjafjalla. Almost half of the northern hemisphere's sky was enveloped by the girl's armpit, and it seemed that the soft skin was enough to destroy everything here by simply touching the ground, crushing all traces of civilization or nature on the surface into dust in the skin's patterns. Then, the scent mixed with the girl's sweat rushed from the depths of her armpit towards the planet, sweeping over most of the planet's land like a storm. Countless drops of crystal-clear sweat towered like mountains next to other, smaller mountains. Even just the small action of Eyjafjalla raising her arm and aiming her armpit at the planet was enough to completely destroy the once complete ecosystem on the planet."
  gts_eyjafjalla.229.desc: "§r“Uhm... My armpit shouldn't have that much sweat, right...?”§!\n\nEyjafjalla's soft voice sounded in space. The girl gently pressed her armpit skin with her other giant hand, making the already magnificent armpit continent appear even larger. With a little hesitation, Eyjafjalla gently exhaled, and then mustered her courage to press against this planet. The pink flesh slammed to the ground. Whether it was the remaining cities and small people or the thin layer of vegetation, all were crushed into powder under the girl's soft skin, mixed with the thick sweat, and eventually became a speck of dust attached to Eyjafjalla's armpit.\n\nThen, as we expected, the energy from this planet began to return to Miss Eyjafjalla's body along her skin. After the first violent expansion, the underarm wall, which was already sufficient to pinch a continent, could now envelop an entire continent, and the fragile crust was almost powerless under Eyjafjalla's body. One abandoned city after another, along with the small people who were unwilling to leave within them, turned into a sweat towel for Eyjafjalla's armpit and were crushed and consumed. Eyjafjalla, whose body was becoming giant-sized, then used the increasingly smaller planet with a comfortable and shy face. When the entire planet was filled with Eyjafjalla's sweat and turned into a “sweat planet”, Eyjafjalla, who had officially become a celestial-level giantess, slowly lowered her arm. This planet, whose size was not even comparable to a single drop of the girl's sweat, finally met its final fate, and gloriously became the first planet to be crushed by the armpit of celestial-level Eyjafjalla."

  d_gts_eyjafjalla_stocking_desc: "The atmosphere, oceans, and land of this planet have been completely permeated and occupied by the scent of Eyjafjalla's boots and stockings."
  gts_eyjafjalla.230.desc: "§r“Since it's like this...”§! Eyjafjalla had completely removed her bra, and two snow-white breasts, as enormous as satellites, floated above the planet. Looking up from the ground, the normally blue sky above the planet had now been completely replaced by a smooth, snow-white expanse. The intense milky fragrance, magnified millions of times, engulfed the planet's atmosphere. Soon, the entire planet was completely enveloped by Eyjafjalla's milky scent.\n\n§r“...Then, let's begin!”§! Eyjafjalla slowly leaned forward, and her two huge nipples, as huge as mountains, gradually broke through the milky atmosphere of the planet and heavily slammed onto the ground. Even the tallest peaks on land were dwarfed in front of these two giant red objects, not to mention the huge breasts behind the nipples and the even more enormous Eyjafjalla herself. The moment the rosy nipple tip touched the ground, everything prosperous on land was crushed to pieces by the seemingly soft, super-giant fleshy wall. As for those small people who insisted on staying on the planet, they either turned into a faint red hue on the fleshy wall under the crushing force of the nipple tip, or they suffocated to death in the atmosphere, which was almost entirely made up of Eyjafjalla's breast scent. Only a very few extremely lucky small people were able to stay in the gap right in the center of Eyjafjalla's nipple tip and had the opportunity to witness the depths of Eyjafjalla's mammary glands, who was about to transform into a goddess.\n\n§r“Uhm... It feels so good...”§! Eyjafjalla, with a flushed face, raised her hands and placed them on her breasts, gently rubbing the snowy white behemoths, while using her nipples to caress the ground. Under the ravaging touch of Eyjafjalla's nipples, the planet's surface became a complete mess. The original gray-green earth could now only be seen as a muddy ground composed of brown traces. And as Eyjafjalla gradually grew, the mountain-sized nipples also grew with the girl's body. And when just the tip of one nipple was the size of a continent, the volcano-like girl finally stopped suppressing her desires and generously erupted her milk after a sensual moan that echoed through the universe. The pure white, viscous liquid filled the entire planet in an instant, and the ocean formed by Eyjafjalla's milk was already hundreds of meters higher than the original horizon. Until the end, Eyjafjalla, who had returned to celestial-level size, exhaled a long breath, and with a “small” hand, lightly brushed away the last bits of the planet's remains from her breast, and shyly covered her face that seemed to be about to drip with blood."
  gts_eyjafjalla.231.name: "“Holy Water” Baptism"
  gts_eyjafjalla.231.desc: "Eyjafjalla's celestial-level transformation plan has been a great success. Now, according to our empire's definition, she has become a standard and great celestial-level giantess. And the planet where she was “born” was stuffed into Eyjafjalla's urethra according to [Root.Ruler.GetName]'s instructions. The camera equipment we had preset on the ground had almost completely recorded the entire process and will soon be released to the whole empire, and even the entire galaxy, to celebrate the birth of yet another celestial-level giantess in the empire. Considering the absolute oppression and deterrence that celestial-level beings have over other lifeforms, it seems that we can also call her the §YEyjafjalla Goddess§!, provided she is willing, of course.\n\nThe several photography facilities remaining on the planet's surface are still faithfully transmitting images, and the video recording of Eyjafjalla's full enlargement process has already been compiled. We can see that Eyjafjalla first gently removed her panties, aiming the abyss between her legs at the planet in front of her. Then, Eyjafjalla, while floating forward, tightly stuck herself to the small planet, allowing her body to crush the surface and her huge mouth engulf the continent below. Every time the planet was destroyed a little more, Eyjafjalla's body expanded accordingly. Everything on the planet was crushed to pieces under the girl's delicate skin, and those minute devotees of Eyjafjalla were also ravaged by the soft fleshy walls below, with only a small portion of them having the chance to enter the girl's urethra below, and these lucky microorganisms will be swept away by the torrent in one of Eyjafjalla's later masturbation or excretions. Until the end, the entire planet has been completely stuffed into the pink tunnel, undulating in Miss Eyjafjalla's pure holy water. Oceans of holy water, hundreds of meters high, have long covered the surface of the planet. Before long, this tiny planet will also be moisturized and assimilated by the girl's holy water in Eyjafjalla's urethra."
  gts_eyjafjalla.232.desc: "§r“Uuuh... Senior actually made such a request...”§! Eyjafjalla, blushing and muttering softly, refused yet welcomed the act of taking off her pink panties, and casually threw them to the side of her body. This single ordinary action created the spectacle of a “panty satellite” for the planet. The girl's tender and delicate vaginal opening was completely exposed to the sky above the planet, and the similarly pink labia slowly writhed under the girl's shy gaze. A fleshy wall almost the size of a mountain surrounded the private part of the girl's crotch. The bottomless secret garden exhaled air currents mixed with the girl's body fragrance and the scent of love fluids. A warm and humid airflow continuously caressed the planet's surface, and pinkish air permeated the planet's atmosphere. For those cities and the small people within them that were directly exposed under her vulva, it seemed that just the scent overflowing from Eyjafjalla's vagina was enough to make them fall into a euphoric stupor.\n\n§r“Then, here I come...!”§! The pink sky was gradually engulfed by the dark vaginal opening, and the labia, like a huge canyon, slowly pressed against the planet under Eyjafjalla's careful control. Whether it was the ruined cities in pieces, the lush vegetation on the planet, or the towering mountains and the tough surface, they were crushed without any resistance at the moment of contact with the girl's soft labia, and ultimately turned into a speck of dust stained on the pink fleshy wall. Then, Eyjafjalla, whose face seemed to be steaming, gently raised two white and tender giant fingers and slowly stretched them towards her crotch. After supporting her two bright red labia, she gently caressed the planet's ground. The soft giant wall, sweeping over the entire continent, wantonly ravaged everything on the crust. A few droplets of crystal clear love fluid, which had already begun to overflow from the depths of her vagina, washed over the dust-like cities like a monstrous wave. Only a few small cities that were fortunate enough to be stuck in the folds of Eyjafjalla's vagina could barely escape the fate of being crushed by the huge fleshy wall, and the microbial-like small people parasitizing in them were also fortunate to catch a glimpse of the girl's secret garden between Eyjafjalla's legs."
  gts_eyjafjalla.233.desc: "§r“Uhm... It feels so good...”§! Eyjafjalla's body gradually expanded as the area of destruction increased, and her increasingly magnificent body gradually hugged the increasingly diminutive planet tighter. The planet she once used her entire body to hug could now be held in her arms. Pieces of wide continents were rolled up and crushed under the fleshy wall that swept over almost half of the planet and turned into wisps of dust that were not even worthy of entering the girl's vagina. At the same time, the love fluid that gushed out from the girl's folds had long since completely replaced all the oceans on this planet. Even the land on the other side of the planet that was not crushed by her labia could not escape the fate of being submerged by the ocean of love fluid.\n\n§r“Uuuh... Uwee!”§! With a sensual moan that echoed through the universe, Eyjafjalla, who had finally yielded to the pleasure in her heart after being stimulated by the planet, reached out and patted the planet, which was now the size of her palm. The love fluid, which gushed out during her climax, was almost entirely captured by the planet's gravity. Under the devastating torrent of love fluid, there was no longer any land or mountain on the entire planet. The even more fragile ruins had long been crushed or submerged by the love fluid, along with the stubborn small people inside. It could even be said that Eyjafjalla's love fluid has now become the new crust of this planet. And after Eyjafjalla's celestial-level transformation was completely finished, the girl, standing between the universe, stuffed the planet, which was only the size of her fingertip, into her lower body, and put on her panties, her face flushed with shame."
  gts_eyjafjalla.234.desc: "§r“Since senior said so...”§! Eyjafjalla, floating in space, carefully held her boots. Her heels, almost the size of a satellite, leaped out of the boot opening. Her rounded heels, wrapped in black silk, along with her slender feet, were pulled out of the boots. An intense scent and large amounts of foot sweat from the girl’s boots, magnified by millions of times, permeated from the boots. Then under the effect of the planet's gravity, it rushed toward the small planet. Soon, just the scent from one of Eyjafjalla's boots occupied most of the atmosphere on the planet. Eyjafjalla's movements did not stop. Although a small, unconscious movement by the girl was enough to bring down divine punishment on this planet, Eyjafjalla, who was still just doing her own thing, reached out again and took off her thin black stocking, tossing it to the side. This in itself created a spectacle for the planet-a “stocking satellite”.\n\nThen, after quickly taking off the boot and stocking on her other foot, Eyjafjalla hesitated a little before finally exhaling a long breath. She then turned her body, raised her two delicate and fair bare feet, and aimed her soles directly at the tiny planet. Looking at it from the pre-set photography equipment on the ground, the once azure sky was completely covered by Eyjafjalla's foot sole. A snow-white continent was suspended above the northern hemisphere of this planet with incomparable oppressive force. Her five slender toes wiggled slightly, bringing storms mixed with the scent of her feet to the small cities beneath, and the patterns on her foot sole divided the vast expanse of the sole's sky, as if any one of these foot lines could allow these small cities and their minute devotees to migrate and colonize.\n\n§r“... Then, let's begin!”§! Her slender legs suddenly stretched forward, and her huge bare feet stepped on the ground of the planet without warning. The area under the girl's feet only had time to record the sudden arrival of darkness and the fall of a fair sky, and then was crushed into soft flesh by the girl's soft sole. Whether it was cities in pieces or lush vegetation, they were almost defenseless under Eyjafjalla’s bare feet, and were crushed underfoot just the same, like patches of grey and green moss. Then, Eyjafjalla, whose body had already begun to expand, raised her other foot and stepped heavily on the continent as well. Everything under her feet turned into a new layer of filth on the girl's foot sole in an instant, and the surging air currents swept across the surrounding earth. The cities that barely survived in the gaps between the toes only survived a few more minutes before being crushed by a few drops of crystalline foot sweat that fell from the toes and became new mud under Eyjafjalla's feet, mixed with her foot dirt.\n\nFoot after foot, Eyjafjalla, who was still suspended in space, shyly continued to step on this abandoned habitable planet, and as we expected, her body gradually expanded. Relatively, the damage she caused each time she stepped down with her bare feet became more and more noticeable. Until Eyjafjalla's foot sole was as big as a continent on the planet, Eyjafjalla, who had once again moved forward, slowly moved her huge feet, wrapping them around the sides of the planet, constantly rubbing the tiny planet with her soles. As for everything on the planet, it had long been turned into a puddle of mud mixed with foot dirt under the ravaging of the massive, super-sized foot sole, and the matter in the surface and mantle was gradually replaced by the girl's foot sweat and foot dirt. Until the end, Eyjafjalla, who had become a celestial-level giantess, smiled shyly and placed the remains of the planet into the gaps between her toes, gently rubbed her toes."

  gts_eyjafjalla.235.desc: "§r“Although it seems that there is no one left on this planet anymore... it still feels weird to do this...”§! A heel, wrapped in black silk, was slowly pulled out of the boot opening. Her slender foot, along with her five slender toes, appeared above the planet. Eyjafjalla, who was now almost like a god, might not have realized that just this small action of hers had brought unimaginable disasters to this planet. The scent of her feet that had been trapped in the boot for several celestial days gushed out from the boot opening. The scent of the girl's foot sweat and foot dirt, along with the scent of her feet, soon rushed toward the small planet under the effect of the planet's gravity. Almost half of the planet's atmosphere was brutally occupied by the scent of Eyjafjalla's socked feet in an instant. The sudden widespread foot-sweat rain and foot-dirt meteorite rain in various parts of the planet had already destroyed the basic landscape of several continents. Numerous cities were also flooded by foot sweat or crushed by foot dirt under such disasters. In other words, even if Eyjafjalla only made the extremely ordinary action of taking off her boots to reveal her silken feet, it would still be enough to destroy most of this planet's ecosystem. And Eyjafjalla's casual action of throwing her boots to the side brought a very rare spectacle of a “giant boot satellite” to this planet.\n\n§r“Then... I'll step down, senior?”§! Eyjafjalla's incomparably huge silken foot gradually approached the fragile planet. The area covered by Eyjafjalla's feet could only see a deepening sense of despair. The silken foot sole, with its incomparable oppressive force, tilted down, and even each thread on the stocking could be clearly seen, or rather... every black thread on the stocking, mixed with sweat or foot dirt, could crush one city after another, destroying one piece of landform after another. And all of this was even just caused by Eyjafjalla gently stepping her silken foot down. However, even though the area around or below Eyjafjalla's silken feet on the ground was already like hell, the huge Eyjafjalla herself still did not have much of a real feeling about it, as if she was stepping on a layer of sand. Eyjafjalla, slightly pouting her small mouth, seemed a little dissatisfied with the planet's fragility, and slowly moved her foot. The super-giant silken foot mountains, wrapped in black silk, rampaged on the land. Everything on the surface passed by the giant foot could not escape the fate of being rolled up into the sole or between the threads of the stocking and being ravaged. Perhaps only the luckiest cities could get stuck in the gaps between the stockings and have a glimpse of the girl's holy feet.\n\n§r“I feel like I am indeed getting bigger... then let's continue!”§! Eyjafjalla's other silken foot also stepped heavily on the planet. The planet, which had already been ravaged into a complete mess, even began to break apart under the trampling of the two continent-sized giant feet. Some crust and mantle matter was thrown up next to Eyjafjalla's foot and then was captured by the gravity of the girl's slender legs, turning into dust between the black silk fibers, and eventually, into dirt mixed with sweat. Then, Eyjafjalla, whose body had expanded once again, chuckled lightly, raised her heel and used her toes to poke into the depths of the planet. Neither the fragile crust and mantle nor the core could stop Eyjafjalla's toes from going deeper. In fact, it could be said that one of Eyjafjalla's toes was now sufficient to become the core of a habitable planet. And as the destroyed area increased, Eyjafjalla's body continued to grow. When the entire planet had been completely shattered by Eyjafjalla's feet, Eyjafjalla, who was finally satisfied, conveniently pulled her boots back from her side, and gently stuffed the tiny remains of the planet into them. After putting her boots back on, she straightened her body in satisfaction and smiled shyly in the direction of our communication. At the same time, countless followers of Miss Eyjafjalla in the empire cheered, celebrating the birth of another great celestial-level giantess. As for the fate of the planet that remained, accompanied by boots and silk-clad feet, perhaps only those people who were still lucky enough to survive between the silk fibers of Eyjafjalla's stockings or the lines of her feet would know."
  gts_eyjafjalla.236.name: "Secluded Abyss"
  gts_eyjafjalla.236.desc: "Eyjafjalla, wearing a swimsuit, took off her panties and knelt on the surface of [event_target:gts_eyjafjalla_planet.GetName]. Still feeling a little shy, the little lamb drew her thighs together, trying to cover her lower body. But for the cities beneath her, Eyjafjalla's little consideration only intensified the heat island effect under her buttocks. The temperature emitted slowly from her labia and butthole had nowhere to escape, and along with the wet gas from her private parts, descended from the sky into the cities, turning this place into the first piece of land transformed by Eyjafjalla's body.\n\nShe reached out and cut off a city district, bringing it up to examine it carefully. In the empty city, only a few machine intelligences were still trying in vain to repair the dilapidated buildings. They, along with the entire city, will be fortunate enough to become the first batch of consumables for Eyjafjalla's ascension into a celestial-level giantess.\n\nEyjafjalla reached a finger towards her butthole and inserted the finger with the small city on the tip into her rectum. In order to ensure full absorption, the little lamb endured the stimulation, and carefully crushed the city's buildings on her intestinal walls. Perhaps some machine intelligences that survived the strong tremors and the erosion of the intestinal fluids could continue their cleaning work in the grooves of the rectum.\n\nThe sense of shame of destroying a thriving city, where the small people were living, by stuffing it inside her lower body and the sense of itchiness caused by the constant friction of the sensitive areas around her butthole, and the euphoria brought by the absorption of stellar energy by the intestinal walls were all intertwined. Eyjafjalla gradually abandoned her initial restraint, and more and more city districts were cut off. Her actions of stuffing them into her butthole became faster and faster unconsciously. However, the rapidly absorbed energy failed to dissipate in time but was instead stimulating the intestinal walls more and more frequently. Despite Eyjafjalla's efforts to endure it, finally, a burst of waste gas, accompanied by a rumbling sound in her belly, was expelled from the confinement of her anus.\n\nThe feeling of relief after holding it in for so long was magnified a hundredfold and a thousandfold by the influence of stellar energy. The little lamb's legs went weak, and she simply lay down on the continent that had been played with beyond recognition. She closed her eyes and completely immersed herself in it, imagining the tiny cities trembling under her buttocks, eventually being overturned by the brownish-yellow air currents from high above, and the area directly under her butthole turning into a wasteland like the center of a nuclear explosion. And the pervasive waste gas stained the entire planet with her scent...\n\nSeveral minutes later, after calming down a little, Eyjafjalla opened her eyes and saw the observation station in near-Earth orbit. As if realizing something, her cheeks instantly turned red.\n\n§r“D-don't...don't film me...”§! The little lamb didn't know whether to cover her face or her lower body, and finally covered her eyes in self-despair."
  gts_eyjafjalla.237.desc: "The constant devouring made Eyjafjalla's body grow rapidly. Finally, Eyjafjalla's body had grown to a near-celestial size. The planet that was the same size as her before could now be held with one hand. Now, there was just one final step before completing her ascension ceremony.\n\nEyjafjalla carefully moved the planet near her butthole. She gently caressed the surface of the planet and pushed this planet, which once protected her, into her rectum. Countless mountains were ground into fragments by her skin and remained around her anus, merging with the filth that remained in the folds even after careful wiping. The main body of the planet arrived safely at the place where it was supposed to be - the vast space within Eyjafjalla's body.\n\nThe planet's remaining observation system was broadcasting the scene within Eyjafjalla's intestines to us in real-time: the planet's sky was covered by dark red fleshy walls, and the sound of intestinal peristalsis from beyond continuously interfered with the planetary communication system. The viscous intestinal fluid dripped on the planet's shields, threatening to break through the shields at any moment and turn the entire planet into a part of her excrement. And further away, a huge, planet-like sphere was quietly blocking the depths of the intestines, vibrating slightly. We detected this dildo when we first encountered Eyjafjalla. Now, in the rectum of this giantess leader, a thriving imperial planet is even more lowly than a dildo covered in mucus, and only this level of man-made object can satisfy her little sexual perversions. Or, could it be that Eyjafjalla has already forgotten the existence of this dildo?\n\nAs if she felt some kind of enormous despair, the observation team activated all the star-level heavy missiles that can be launched normally in [event_target:gts_eyjafjalla_planet.GetName]'s armory and launched them towards the dildo. The result was obvious. After a few muffled sounds, the missiles failed to wound the dildo in the slightest, and the energy of the explosion was completely absorbed. This round of cross-galaxy missile attack, which was originally planned to prevent a natural disaster, happened quickly and dissipated quickly in Eyjafjalla's rectum, without even attracting her attention.\n\n§r“Eh, why does it feel a little itchy... Ah! That... it's the one Amiya and the others bought before...”§! The dildo, which was activated with energy, began to vibrate wildly, finally making Eyjafjalla notice the abnormality in her rectum.\n§r“Oh no, it seems to be too deep inside, I can't reach it at all...”§! Her huge fingers were groping around wildly in the small universe inside her body, stirring up the planet, fluids, and filth inside her intestines, and the instigator of all of this [event_target:gts_eyjafjalla_planet.GetName], along with mucus, was all smeared on the fingerprints, completely soaked in sweat and intestinal fluid. After an unsuccessful search, Eyjafjalla had no choice but to give up and pull her fingers out.\n\n§r“Uhm... a bit disgusting...”§! Eyjafjalla vigorously flicked the mucus off her fingertips. §r“I need to quickly go find the senior to turn that thing off.”§!"

  gts_eyjafjalla.240.name: "Good Night, Eyjafjalla"
  gts_eyjafjalla.240.desc: "「I’ve gone far enough away from the galaxy, right…?」\n\nBefore the words could finish, her soft pink lips were already slightly pouting - drowsiness had long since made Eyjafjalla’s brain mushy, and the light-colored nebula in her vision became blurry as her eyelids closed, just like a cotton candy that one could hold in their hand.\n\n「Then, I’ll just rest here, senior… Good night」 The words of farewell turned into a sleepy murmur, and on the other end of the planet, whether or not the senior in the little lamb’s words would be fortunate enough to hear those torturous words with their ears.\n\nIn a daze, Eyjafjalla took off the cloak she was wearing, then unbuttoned her outer clothes one by one, and then grabbed the slightly scorched hem of her skirt and lifted it upward - \n\nThe smooth plains of her belly, the still-immature shape of her pink bra, the pure white armpits slightly stained with sweat, and Eyjafjalla’s cheeks, blushed to just the right degree… The stars in the galaxy, along with the removal of her clothes, flowed toward the little lamb's healthy body like a luminous patch of sand.\n\nBending down, Eyjafjalla tried to untie the laces of her long boots, and the many planets that were in the background of the little lamb’s body melted like sugar onto the little lamb’s skin.\n\nA bit cold and a bit itchy… Under the stimulation, the little lamb instinctively shook her body, but she was still focused on the boot whose laces had just been untied. She pinched the heel and gently pulled, and her rounded heel wrapped in black silk slipped out. After lifting her foot gently, a small number of unlucky planets were pulled into the boot, which was still emitting heat.\n\n「And then, removing the leggings…」\n\nThe fingertips inserted into the gap of the leggings, and the silk threads of the trouser opening also dug into the little lamb's thighs. The strawberry-colored panties peeked out until the fingertips had slipped past the knees. However, the little lamb, whose mind was filled with drowsiness, seemed to remember something, and clamped her legs together and gently rubbed them.\n\n「Uhm, I can't take them off here, if there’s a starship passing by, they’ll see everything」\n\nShe tucked the panties back into the shadow of the leggings. Also trapped in the leggings were a few small planets. The black silk threads were like a huge net covering the sky, driving the lost stars into the cotton blanket under the little lamb’s panties, in that hormonally soothing comforter. \n\nEverything was light and airy. Worries and thoughts slipped away quietly, just like the pink sheep in Siesta at dusk…\n\n「It feels like a cloud when I touch it, but... I can even hold a nebula in one hand now」\n\nEyjafjalla stretched out her hand, went around that dense nebula. Then, her pinkish-white background appeared again, and this dark red nebula also became the embellishment between the little lamb's fingers.\n\n「It seems like something is still missing…」 Her palm moved slightly, and finally, the nebula stopped on the ring finger of Eyjafjalla's right hand. The nebula, captured by the little lamb's finger, cast a bright red light on her skin, making the fingers, which already seemed as white as scallions, appear rosy. As if she had remembered something, Eyjafjalla's face could not help but show a suppressed smile…\n\n「Phew, good night, tiny nebula…」 Eyjafjalla reluctantly pulled her hand back, and gently entered her dreams"

  gts_eyjafjalla.250.desc: "「Shortly after Eyjafjalla grew into a celestial-level giantess, we received a request letter from the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In their letter, they expressed their hope to organize a science team to go to Eyjafjalla's body to map her physical data.\n\nWe had already recorded her physical data in detail during our pre-employment physical examination and Oripathy treatment, but after she devoured the world and grew into a celestial-level giantess, most of this data was no longer accurate. Besides, just thinking about conducting an on-site survey of the body of this celestial-level alien girl, it is clear how much research data and precious materials we will get from this action.\n\nBut it is also obvious that even with the most advanced equipment of the empire, exploring on the body of a celestial-level giantess is extremely risky. Any small, unconscious movement of Eyjafjalla could bring a devastating disaster to the exploration team. Therefore, after prudent discussion, we decided to start the mapping project from Eyjafjalla's feet。」"

Here, the terrain is high and the geology is hard, making evacuation easy even if they encounter danger. In addition, in order to minimize the potential harm to the exploration team caused by Miss Eyjafjalla's emotional fluctuations, this operation will be kept secret from her throughout.\n\nAfter everything was ready, during Eyjafjalla's sleeping time, with the help of a naval landing ship, the exploration team passed through the black silk gap and successfully landed on her sole. After reporting their safety to us, they immediately cut off communication.\n\nThe next regular communication will be restarted in five standard months."

Only her slow breathing, which was exhaling stardust, and sporadic sleep-talking reminded us that this was a giantess the size of a celestial body. In any case, this is a very favorable exploration environment for our exploration team.\n\nExploration team communication: We have been traveling on the foothills of the sole for several months. As the pressure-bearing surface of Eyjafjalla's sole, the only scenery we can see on this flesh-colored wilderness is the shattered stardust and flattened building clusters. However, away from the original route, we can vaguely see a continuous gold-brown high wall. We cannot be sure if this is a mirage, but since we have plenty of time, why not take a detour to have a look?"

Her mind after growing now has a computing power comparable to a scientific hub on her own, which also makes her more dependent on sweets to maintain her energy. However, instead of waiting slowly for the empire to ship in batches of saccharin, and then swallowing them all at once into a bottomless sea of gastric juice, Eyjafjalla prefers to lick lava planets nearby to satisfy her cravings. Perhaps for a former volcano scholar, only lava can give her enough stimulation.\n\nExploration team communication: After traversing who knows how many flesh-colored hills, we finally arrived at the center line of this sole - a huge canyon that spans from north to south. The tiny streams in the canyon will form a magnificent sweat river downstream of the sole after the accumulation of sweat drops along the way, but that is not the target of our current exploration.\n\nStrolling through the canyon, fragments of buildings and mechanical wreckage can be seen everywhere on both sides of the riverbed. Most of them have lost their research value due to the squeezing of flesh walls and the erosion of the sweat river. However, if we spend more time searching here, we may be able to find something useful."

Fortunately, advanced information technology allows her to read the books she wants in her spare time. However, judging from the borrowing records, novels that were popular in the pre-space era, with stories of romance between younger and older students, seem to be the most pleasing to this giantess who is comparable to a god. At this moment, she was reading manga while enjoying a special afternoon tea, and her feet were also lightly quivering with ease.\n\nExploration team communication: After crossing the canyon, we climbed onto the highlands on the other side of the sole. At the summit of this plateau, the connecting point of heaven and earth, is one of the outlets for the scent of socks on this foot. It is also our agreed evacuation point. During the climb, our observers discovered an unnaturally formed depression in the distance. Perhaps something is trapped there, which has been squeezed by this giant foot for a long time without collapsing, instead, it has become embedded in the highlands of this sole."

Later, we expanded the search area, but we still couldn't find them. Afterward, we discovered that Eyjafjalla had signs of putting on her boots, and the evacuation forces had to retreat quickly. As she put on her boots and stamped her feet, the fate of the exploration team became imaginable.\n\nOut of fear that Eyjafjalla would feel guilty if she found out, we could only destroy all documents related to this operation.

However, the recent space psionic storm that swept through several galaxies made Eyjafjalla decide to put on a few more clothes. Although she won't catch a cold because of this, it would be bad if she sneezed non-stop and caused a new space storm. The little lamb chose for a long time and finally put on the long coat she used to wear when she was working, and put on her boots as well.\n\nExploration team communication: Our exploration journey has been bumpy from the start. In the past, although black silk covered the sky, we could still observe and locate from the stars through the mesh. But now, for some reason, we can no longer observe the world outside of the black silk, and the weather has become foggy too. This has forced us to be more cautious when passing through the foot dirt swamp on Miss Eyjafjalla's arch.\n\nHowever, the hot and humid environment has made this land softer. Someone suggested that it would be better to set up camp here and, while waiting for the fog to dissipate naturally, collect some fresh sweat dirt to take back for analysis."

For example, she must grasp the distance from the sun well. If she gets too close accidentally, she might burn her clothes, or when she sleeps next to the sun, her huge breasts will often block the parts above the northern hemisphere, which will cause her to feel cold in her head. Now Eyjafjalla is more used to lifting up her top and pressing the star tightly against her navel to keep warm.\n\nExploration team communication: Finally, we reached the vast sweat river, and our previous hard exploration was completely worth it for the sight before us. The exploration team excitedly decided to name this great river after Miss Eyjafjalla.\n\nWhile observing the water flow, we found that the Eyja River is now showing a faint trend of rising water levels. We can cross the river early, but we can also seize the opportunity to reach the deep water area and complete the water sample collection task before the water level surge."

Scratching directly with her hands seems a bit ungraceful, and it is obviously more comfortable to rub her feet repeatedly on a desolate planet with rough rocks. However, that planet will be smaller because of it. Before resuming mining work, she also has to clean up the skin flakes and sweat and mud that covers the planet.\n\nExploration team communication: The ridge is close at hand, but when we camped at the foot of the mountain a few days ago, we were awakened by a violent roar. We then saw a spherical behemoth press the distant black silk sky to the ground and then repeatedly ran it over for several hours, after which everything returned to normal.\n\nWe rushed to the scene of the incident and finally found a hidden fungal forest. The fungi that make up the forest emit a red glow and feel exceptionally warm to the touch. When cooked at high temperature, they taste like Eyjafjalla's jade feet. Although these hyphae will not cause any harm to Miss Eyjafjalla, their spores seem to cause her to itch, which is probably the reason why this forest has incurred divine punishment.\n\nUnder the nourishment of surface oils and sweat, we found that new hyphae had already sprung up from the ground. According to this growth rate, the entire forest may return to its original state within two or three days. I think we can collect some of this magical fungus and take it back for further study."

However, this kind of exercise always ends up with Eyjafjalla covered in fragrant sweat and asteroid fragments, and cleaning her body has become a hassle for her.\n\nExploration team communication: The archeological exploration between the toes is more difficult than we expected. The portable excavators take a long time to break through the sweat dirt congealed on the surface of the skin. While waiting for the demolition, the science team members can only engage in repetitive work, such as atmospheric and water observation.\n\nBut dramatically, the ground temperature suddenly began to rise recently, and a large amount of sweat poured out from tiny pores everywhere, along with it, genetic material and ancient relics that were deeply buried under the skin were also rolled out.

Fortunately, we were fast enough. While climbing her toe pad, we witnessed the shocking scene of a planet falling between two toes and then undergoing fusion and exploding in the squeeze.\n\nOur former landing point has now been submerged by thousands of meters deep sweat and seawater. If Miss Eyjafjalla wants to recycle it, she might put this planet, which is covered in her foot sweat, back in place and wait for tens of thousands of years for ecological restoration. However, judging from her actions of putting on her socks, the fate of this planet will probably be that it will be crushed between her toes after she is done playing with it.\n\nFor us, this is an opportunity to observe the power of a celestial-level giantess up-close. I think we can go back the way we came, and collect rock samples from the planet that was squeezed. Perhaps we can also find some usable fuel supplies."
