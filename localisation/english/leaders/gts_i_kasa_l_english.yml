  gts_kasa.100.name: "Living Universe Kasa"
  gts_kasa.2.desc: "Hello, I believe you are already aware of my arrival, allow me to introduce myself.\n\nI am Kasa, a living universe and also a collector~ You should have already encountered the communication crystal I left in this world, indicating you are capable enough to engage in... trade with me. Please rest assured, I have no reason to involve myself in the conflicts of your world~ But please rest assured, I am here waiting. If you are ready, we can commence trading anytime~~"
  gts_kasa.2.a: "Where do you come from? What is your purpose?"
  gts_kasa.2.a.response: "Hmm, I come from another world, in terms you can understand, from a 'parallel world.'\n\n(Gently blinks, appearing interested in your question)\n\nI travel across worlds and universes to witness various civilizations, creatures, and races. My purpose is simple~ to collect precious items for me and store them properly within my main body~ Oh, please rest assured, I do not forcibly collect; my collections willingly enter my body~"
  gts_kasa.2.b: "What happened to this planet? It looks... completely different."
  gts_kasa.2.b.response: "This planet does not belong to your world. Strictly speaking... it is a fragment I sent to this world, another part of me~ Rest assured, by your standards, my body can be considered a 'Gaia planet.' If you wish to settle within my body, I do not mind at all~~"
  gts_kasa.2.c: "We want to trade."
  gts_kasa.2.c.response: "Of course, you can~~ Whether it be your food, energy, minerals, or technology~ even your population, troops, fleets, and those little trinkets in your museums are acceptable to me~~\n\n(Gently licks lips, greedily rubbing belly)\n\n§S(You can trade with Kasa via communication interface!)§!"

Hmm~ I've received them~ Check your warehouse~ the trade is complete~~"
