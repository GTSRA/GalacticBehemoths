  gts_mizuki.1.name: "Deep Blue Tree"
  gts_mizuki.1.desc: "Ever since the giantess named Mizuki joined our empire, our research department has meticulously studied the unusual charges on Mizuki's body. We've stabilized her pink electric sparks through some methods. Following that, we sent teams to explore Mizuki's body multiple times to locate valuable resources. Initially, Mizuki felt shy about tiny people crawling on her, but she permitted our activities, moving her planetary-sized body cautiously to avoid hurting our facilities and staff.\n\nHowever, as we prepared to venture into Mizuki's intimate areas (upon which she blushed deeply before nodding slightly), we encountered another anomaly: a deep blue, fungal-like carpet laying between her soft pink folds, spanning two folds of her vast walls, extending into her private area. While this fine-grained anomaly went unnoticed by Mizuki, it blocked our further exploration and building plans.\n\nMore puzzlingly, as our giantess exploration team considered these fungi a new viral form and readied to clear them, the fungi seemingly came alive, with deep blue tendrils emerging and attacking our team. Unprepared, they had to retreat chaotically, requesting a reassessment of the anomalies in Mizuki's private areas."
  gts_mizuki.1.a: "Fascinating"
  gts_mizuki_special_project_1: "Rejection Reaction"
  gts_mizuki_special_project_1_DESC: "Our exploration plan into Miss Mizuki's intimate areas has faced unexpected impediments. Unidentified fungi and tendrils have blocked our path deeper into her body. The scientific department hypothesizes these organisms could be a new fungal species brought by Mizuki from her world. Therefore, we must swiftly address these strange blue structures for our construction plans' sake and Mizuki's health."
  gts_mizuki.2.name: "Deep Abyss Fades"
  gts_mizuki.2.desc: "Our army has landed on Mizuki's labia and begun clearing the fungi with conventional weapons. Laser and kinetic weapons don't harm Mizuki's celestial-scale soft skin and pink areas, yet significantly damage the fungi and tendrils. However, as the clearing proceeded, the fungi within Mizuki's more profound folds showed increased resistance, compounded by the obscuring presence of her crystalline, viscous secretions.\n\nFortunately, with our subsequent support and Mizuki's 'assistance,' we successfully eradicated the deep blue fungi, collecting inactive samples for study. These materials might provide insights into the biological structures from another universe.\n\nUpon showing Mizuki the magnified fungi images, she hesitated, revealing their name as “Abyssal Marks.” She mentioned only one other entity capable of generating these marks and tendrils, usually referred to as a 'Seahag.'\n\nEvidently, within Mizuki's intimate depths exists an intelligent lifeform from the same universe as Mizuki. While Mizuki described the entity’s 'Originium Arts' being less grand than hers, more akin to average intelligent life in the galaxy, further exploration of Mizuki’s depths is warranted to find this mysterious lifeform."
  gts_mizuki.2.a: "Continue Investigation"
  gts_mizuki_special_project_2: "Mirage"
  gts_mizuki_special_project_2_DESC: "Based on Mizuki's descriptions and our observations, a 'Seahag' from the same universe might reside within her intimate depths. To locate this 'Abyssmark' lifeform, we've launched a special project deep into Mizuki's private area. If successful, we can invite another being from a different universe to join our empire. Mizuki, blushing in embarrassment, is now waiting near §Y[Root.capital_scope.GetName]§! with her continent-sized panties removed in vacuum conditions."
  gts_mizuki.3.name: "As Blue as Stars"
  gts_mizuki.3.desc: "Our team has advanced past Mizuki's intimate entrance into deep pink walls. Struggling through dark red, warm air and mountainous droplets of secretions, they pause before proceeding past each fold on Mizuki’s enormous body. The cosmic-scale intimidation is strong, especially realizing their entire world-view is a tiny part of a girl’s skin.\n\nDirection detection becomes hard in Mizuki's intimate depths, surrounded by endless deep pink walls subtly moving. Occasionally, ocean-wide torrents of secretions rush overhead. Losing course here means eternal entrapment as microorganisms.\n\nFortunately, our research department discovered that bringing collected 'Abyssmark' samples nearer to their origin revives their vitality, helping us locate the 'Seahag.'\n\nAfter a grueling four-month exploration, our team successfully found the 'Seahag' living in Mizuki's intimate depths. Communicating using the same language as Mizuki, they reported the 'Seahag' has short blue hair and a deep blue hat, expressing interest in speaking to our leader."

  gts_mizuki.4.name: "Connect Signal"
  gts_mizuki.4.desc: "“So hot, so hot... wait, is it connected?”\n'Hello--'\n\n“Huh? Don't speak so loudly? Okay...”\n\n“Anyway, call me `Suigetsu`. It's nice to meet a civilization that looks similar to humans, even here.”"
  gts_mizuki.4.a: "Where do you come from?"
  gts_mizuki.5.name: "Connect Signal"
  gts_mizuki.5.desc: "“I’m from a land called Terra and a landship named Rhodes Island... Before coming here, I was about to visit Susie and her newly opened salon, but got engulfed by intense white light upon opening a door.”\n\n“When I awoke, I was in this place. It was initially hard to adapt to the dark, humid conditions alone, though Seahag adaptability helped. Few could solo survive this grandeur.”\n\n“...Yet, your... agent told me this immense realm... the distant pink sky and walls... were inside Susie? And the pervasive crystalline liquids are her secretions?”\n\n“(Agorian exclamation), how big is she now...”"
  gts_mizuki.5.a: "Why haven't you grown like Mizuki..."
  gts_mizuki.6.name: "Connect Signal"
  gts_mizuki.6.desc: "“Hmm... not sure. Maybe because I 'intruded' the light while Susie was 'chosen' by it?”\n\n“Since Susie's grown into... such a large entity, she wouldn't need our protection anymore, so it's no big deal.”"
  gts_mizuki.6.a: "What's a 'Seahag'?"
  gts_mizuki.7.name: "Connect Signal"
  gts_mizuki.7.desc: "“Initially, neither I, Susie, nor anyone on Terra could define it precisely,”\n\n“But now, after your agent shared this universe's knowledge... I know, a 'Seahag' is one kind of hive mind, burdened with planetary transformation duties, yet gradually corrupted over ages.”\n\n“Ah, I'm a Seahag too,”\n\n“However, being a Seahag has perks-like lacking distinct sexual characteristics initially, or switching bodies. If you want, I could even morph into a different gender...”"
  gts_mizuki.7.a: "What's your future plan?"
  gts_mizuki.8.name: "Connect Signal"
  gts_mizuki.8.desc: "“I'm not clear yet... I’ve only been in this universe a few years, and all the incoming info and evolution paths near Seahag's limit...”\n\n“So, if you can, would you give me some advice?”"
  gts_mizuki.8.a: "Joining us might be a good choice"
  gts_mizuki.8.a.tooltip: "§YSuigetsu will join us§!"

  gts_mizuki.999.desc: "Join you all...? \nHmm... it might indeed be a good choice."
  gts_mizuki.999.a: "How about becoming a commander?"
  gts_mizuki.999.a.response: "Huh? Like a doctor commanding agents, controlling the battlefield? \n\nWhat? Not agents, but a fleet? \n\nSounds daunting... but I’ll strive hard not to disappoint!"
  gts_mizuki.999.b: "If you had the chance... would you want to grow like Mizuki?"
  gts_mizuki.999.b.response: "Your shrinking and enlarging hormones are indeed miraculous... but I’m not in a hurry. And from my observations, so are all your leaders... so, give me some time to reshape my body..."
  gts_mizuki.999.c: "Welcome to §Y[Root.GetName]§! "
  gts_mizuki.999.c.response: "Yay! Can't believe how friendly the first civilization I meet here is... So, from now on, Rhodes Island special agent, §Y[Root.GetName]§! fleet commander Suigetsu, pleased to meet you!"
