  gts_fjb_ruined_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS: "This colossal construct is a relic left behind by a civilization that once served futanari giants."
  gts_fjb_0: "Giant Onahole"
  gts_fjb_0_DESC: "A megastructure built around a black hole, consisting of a vast hollow cavity surrounded by reinforced alloy. When a futanari giantess masturbates, the black hole's suction stimulates the glans, mimicking oral sex. Most precum and semen gets absorbed into the singularity, with only residual traces collectable from the inner walls."

  # Preceding events
  gts_doctor_anomaly: "Lost Contact"

  gts_doctor_anomaly_desc: "A previously contacted primitive civilization underwent inexplicably rapid development before suddenly severing all communications yesterday. Our science vessels detect extreme thermal emissions from their system's core - warranting investigation."
  gts_doctor.2.name: "Annihilation"
  gts_doctor.2.desc: "Initial scans from safe distance reveal planets crusted with semen layers that repeatedly reshaped their topography. Interplanetary space now holds semen rings instead of asteroid belts. The central star bears evidence of violent penetration. 99.9% of native life was undoubtedly eradicated. Kilometer-long sperm strands confirm involvement by an unrecorded celestial-scale futanari giantess, whose most recent emission suggests recent proximity.\n\nRecommend elevating navigation risk assessment to level 3-4 in adjacent sectors."

  gts_doctor.2.a: "Sweet merciful..."
  gts_doctor.3.name: "Threat Detection"
  gts_doctor.3.desc: "Gravimetric alarms trigger emergency protocols as the AI calculates our inevitable encounter. Any incidental motion from the entity ahead could obliterate us. The bridge falls silent during the agonizing FTL spool-up sequence, all praying to escape before being crushed by unconscious movement.\n\nLast drone feeds show blurred imagery - a shoeless woman in black upperwear and stockings, her face obscured, with curves visibly perfect despite the astronomical size disparity."

  gts_doctor.3.a: "Go go go!"
  gts_doctor.4.name: "First Contact"
  gts_doctor.4.desc: "\"Hmm? More little visitors~? Oops, might've gotten carried away~\"\n\nHer slight head tilt annihilates the system's remaining planets. Our shields barely withstand the shockwave, sustaining only drive and system damage.\n\n\"Testing~ Can you hear me? Had to improvise since you're practically microscopic~ No worries, I'll be gentle~\"\n\nThe giantess hijacks our comms, her hooded face filling screens as a black-gloved hand waves. Her androgynous voice's playful tone eases tension slightly."

  gts_doctor.4.a: "Establish dialogue!"

  gts_doctor.5.b: "Your origin?"
  gts_doctor.5.b.response: "\"Truthfully... my memories are fragmented. I seemingly manifested in the void. Attempts to shrink down and live among civilizations usually ended... poorly.\"\n"
  gts_doctor.5.c: "Did you flood that system?"
  gts_doctor.5.c.response: "\"(Glances at bulging crotch) Everyone needs release~ Wouldn't want to accidentally fill the universe, hm? Oh don't look so horrified - just teasing~\"\n"

  gts_doctor.10.name: "Originium"
  gts_doctor.10.desc: "§H\"It serves not only as an extraordinarily efficient energy source, but can also store anything at will - whether fleets or documents at your fingertips... As for capacity, worry not, it self-replicates...\"§!\n\n[Root.Capital.GetName] Parliamentary Hearing. The Doctor's holographic projection casually twirls a specialized containment device holding asteroid-sized black ore - the very §H\"Originium\"§! she previously mentioned developing with a colleague. This hearing serves to introduce this mineral and discuss its exploitation potential."

  gts_doctor.10.a: "..."
  gts_doctor.11.desc: "§H\"I personally possess administrative privileges over Originium,\"§!\n\nThe Doctor carefully extracts a fragment that transforms into a staggering megastructure at her snap. Even the least technologically literate parliamentarians recognize this far exceeds our capabilities.\n\n§H\"Should you require, I can 'unpack' anything imaginable. Consider this demonstration my gift~\"§!\n\nConservative opposition melts away upon witnessing this miracle, though hardliners still caution against accepting such boons. Pro-mining factions enthusiastically extol Originium's strategic value to [Root.GetRulerName]. Noticing her creation's reception, the celestial Doctor permits herself a faint smile...\n\nWith the hearing concluding and parliament divided, [Root.GetRulerName] studies the ore's prismatic gaze-like facets and decides..."
  gts_doctor.11.a: "We cannot accept such hazardous creations."
  gts_doctor.11.b: "This marvel shall serve our purposes."

  gts_doctor.20.name: "Photographic Evidence"
  gts_doctor.20.desc: "[Root.GetRulerName]'s office. The Doctor receives an envelope from an aide containing images of: planets violently penetrated bearing massive handprints; world-spanning semen crusts forming orbital rings; cityscapes transformed into fractured craters filled with rubble and reddish-black sludge.\n\n§rDuring your tenure, you alone devastated multiple worlds - including one inhabited civilization suffering 98% casualties and near-total uninhabitability. How do you explain this?§!\n\nThe culprit vividly recalls each sensation: cities crumbling beneath her soles, tiny weapons fire tickling her glans during masturbation, the exquisite thrill of planetary penetration. Lowering her head, the Doctor elaborates on her motivations..."
  gts_doctor.20.a: "Let it slide."
  gts_doctor.20.a.tooltip: "§RVerbal warnings won't suppress biological needs...§!"
  gts_doctor.20.b: "Commission an onahole megastructure."

  gts_doctor.21.name: "Additional Evidence"
  gts_doctor.21.desc: "[Root.GetRulerName]'s desk now holds more reconnaissance images: planets destroyed mid-penetration, semen geysers frozen mid-eruption. The Doctor's \"play sessions\" now consume entire star systems, with her activities creeping dangerously close to our core worlds. Scientific advisors warn unchecked escalation threatens national security.\n\nRubbing his temples, [Root.GetRulerName] never anticipated such uncontrollable... appetites. A decision must be made..."
  gts_doctor.21.a: "She'll burn out eventually."
  gts_doctor.21.b: "Time to build her a proper outlet."

  gts_doctor.22.name: "Annihilation"
  gts_doctor.22.desc: "As [Root.GetRulerName] watches Originium clusters engulf [Root.Capital.GetName] beneath the spectral outline of a hovering glans, he remembers vetoing the onahole proposal decades ago.\n\nThe Doctor's libido defied all predictions, growing exponentially alongside her immeasurable size. Our instruments long ago ceased meaningful measurement - only registering masturbatory tremors and semen-flooded galaxies. Communication attempts now yield only wanton moans. Most alarmingly, she approaches our capital system.\n\nAt DEFCON 1, Originium-powered weapons activate: reactors hum, battleships roar, teleportation networks flash. Unnoticed, black ore emerges within devastated systems' semen seas...\n\nOur entire arsenal fires simultaneously - gigawatt lasers scorch cosmic-spanning stockings, energy beams sear gloves, giantesses charge the erect monolith to shield worlds from pre-ejaculate tsunamis. The coup de grâce: antimatter warheads capable of shattering planets (technology ironically gifted by the Doctor).\n\nThe blinding detonations fade to reveal... an unscathed phallus eclipsing the galaxy. As attacks continue, the Doctor simply snaps her fingers. Originium in engines, megastructures, and even planetary cores violently expands - shredding ships, terraforming landscapes into crystalline spires, assimilating living flesh. [Root.GetRulerName] stares at his petrifying arm, the ore's prismatic facets whispering madness as the Doctor's moans crescendo. His final sight: a tidal wave of white oblivion."

  gts_doctor.22.a: "§CWe'll meet again...§!"
  gts_doctor.23.name: "Internalized Cosmos"
  gts_doctor.23.desc: "A white-clad woman treads crystalline ground, toying with black orbs matching those floating around her. Violet eyes study the colossal prism dominating the sky. Sensing presence behind her, she crushes the orbs and sighs.\n\n§C\"...Were those trinkets worth centuries of neglect?\"§!\n§H\"Well... this time...\"§! The stammering white-haired woman fidgets with her coat.\n\n§C\"Nevermind. Where's AMA—Kalt'sit?\"§!\n\n§H\"Right here~\"§! She reveals a curled-up feline girl in her palm.\n\nIn sudden passion, the white-clad woman tackles her lover, tearing away skirt and panties to expose the throbbing monument between her thighs.\n\n§H\"Pr-Professor? Here? I just crushed several universes...\"§!\n§C\"Their data's preserved in Originium. Now... let's reconnect properly.\"§! Garments discarded, their primal union begins..."

  gts_doctor.23.a: "Fin."
  gts_doctor.30.name: "Custom Onahole"
  gts_doctor.30.desc: "Geological survey ships mapped the Doctor's erect majesty (with catastrophic casualties) to engineer this megastructure. Workers in hazmat suits operate semen processing facilities as the colonyship-sized onahole withstands violent thrusting, its interior slick with precum.\n\nWhen cataclysmic tremors and deafening fluid roars subside, cheers replace alarm sirens - the structure survived. As the Doctor withdraws her glistening member, she murmurs:\n\n§H\"Mmm... still not as good as the old one...\"§!"
  gts_doctor.30.a: "Success!"

  gts_doctor.31.name: "Onahole Down!"
  gts_doctor.31.desc: "The final transmission shows a veteran engineer futilely bracing against the semen tsunami.\n\nDespite advanced Originium tech, maintaining such structures proves unsustainable. An engineer-turned-legislator proposes an alternative..."

  gts_doctor.31.a: "Enough. We won't waste more resources on her."
  gts_doctor.32.name: "Onahole MKII"
  gts_doctor.32.desc: "The Doctor eagerly penetrates the event horizon. Months of abstinence make this encounter explosive - each thrust against the singularity's pull brings volcanic ejaculations immediately harvested by drones.\n\nThis black hole solution eliminates maintenance costs while better satisfying her needs. Still, she remarks:\n\n§H\"Much improved~ But something's still missing...\"§!"
  gts_doctor.32.a: "What will it take to satisfy her?!"
