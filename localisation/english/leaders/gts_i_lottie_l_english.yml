  ### Rawls Communication Access
  gts_rawls.1.name: "Communication from the Unknown"
  gts_rawls.1.desc: "Just as we completed contact with this special giantess, we received a communication request from an unknown sender. Strangely, they seem to have already learned our language, with all the text written in our common tongue."
  gts_rawls.1.a: "Accept the connection"
  gts_rawls.2.desc: "\"Greetings, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]. It seems you've already met my child...\"\n\nOn the other end of the communication screen is a young girl.\n\n\"My name is Rawls, one of her creators. Along with April and other companions, I created these lovely girls. Oh yes, and there are many more waiting for you to meet...\"\n\nRawls closed the book in her hand and looked at you."
  gts_rawls.2.A: "You're a... creator?"
  gts_rawls.3.desc: "Yes, that's right."
  gts_rawls.3.a: "Then who created you?"
  gts_rawls.3.a.response: "Rawls smiled.\n\"I created myself, it was a bit rushed, but I think you shouldn't dislike the image I've drawn, right?\""
  gts_rawls.3.b: "Then can you become a legendary leader for me to use!"
  gts_rawls.3.b.response: "\"No,\" Rawls replied immediately.\n\"I don't want to become someone's electronic pet.\"\n\n\"Besides, I'm quite lazy, and I don't want to work either. Creating these giantesses has already exhausted me.\" Rawls leaned back in her chair."
  gts_rawls.3.c: "How do I find the other giantesses?"
  gts_rawls.4.desc: "\"Hmm... that's something you'll have to find on your own. Or you could try contacting me through other means, interdimensional communication provides limited information.\" Rawls adjusted her glasses.\n\"Anyway, I'll leave you a way to contact me. If you want to chat with the giantesses who have joined you, or if you have any business with them, you can come to me and I'll help connect you.\""
  gts_rawls.4.A: "Okay, I've noted your number."
  gts_rawls.4.A.tooltip: "We can trigger communication with Rawls through an edict."

I want this group, and that group, oh oh, those little people are also so cute! I'll take them all, hehe.\" Lottie smashes the city with her feet, while lightly stepping with her sweat-covered white silk stockinged feet back and forth over the dense crowds, trying to stick more people to the soles of her stockings, then puts her feet into the shoes she removed, letting the little people land on the insoles.\n\nFinally, after destroying a dozen cities, Lottie's shoes were finally filled with little people.

  # Lottie Archaeological Event
  site_gtsra_lottie: "The Fall of Yaitallis"

  site_gtsra_lottie_intro: "The city ruins scattered across the surface of this dead planet are extremely irregular, and worth investigating."
  gts_lottie_site.1.name: "A Planet Trampled by Giant Feet"
  gts_lottie_site.1.desc: "Our survey team has descended through the thick clouds and landed on the planet's surface. Here, as on other planets that have met a similar fate, the ground is covered in giantess footprints, and the air is filled with toxic dust. The entire ecosystem has been completely destroyed. The team leader is leading the team to investigate the strange city ruins, hoping to find out what happened here as soon as possible."

  gts_lottie_site.1.A: "Very well, continue the investigation"
  gts_lottie_site.2.name: "Mobile Cities"
  gts_lottie_site.2.desc: "Initial surveys have produced results. Our team has entered the ruins and quickly noticed the anomaly of these buildings - they are not built on the ground. The cities seem to be built on blocks, unit by unit, and some buildings are stacked directly on top of each other. Though modular design is not surprising, the splicing between these \"modules\" is clearly terrible. Many roads do not align, some modules are separated by hundreds of meters of gaps, while others overlap, causing the buildings to collide. \"Speaking of collisions,\" says the team leader, \"there are no mobile devices on these platforms. Therefore, those with such brute force must be the legendary Titan giantesses.” Which naughty girl used these buildings as building blocks, ultimately leading to the destruction of the planet's civilization? With this in mind, the captain suggests heading to the city center to see if there are any records in the archives about this instigator. This should help us better understand these giant girls."

  gts_lottie_site.2.A: "Okay, let's continue"
  gts_lottie_site.3.name: "A Peculiar Structure"
  gts_lottie_site.3.desc: "In the ruins of the city center, the survey team's path was blocked by a towering wall. This wall is estimated to be hundreds of meters high, taller than most buildings in the city. It extends to both sides, curving backward. It doesn't look like a building, but more like... a wall? Due to the smog, we can't see its full scale , but this high wall is not as dilapidated as the other buildings in the city. It is very intact, without any damages on the surface. This discovery has made the team excited, indicating either it survived the disaster, or was built after the fact. It is, therefore, possible that there are survivors! The captain decided to split the team in two: one group to prepare climbing equipment to get over the wall, and the other to bypass the wall and look for the archives."

  gts_lottie_site.3.A: "I have an uneasy feeling"
  gts_lottie_site.5.name: "Maids Who Carry Cities"
  gts_lottie_site.5.desc: "Soon, the puzzle was partially solved. Posters found by the archive team explained the truth about these mobile cities - they were transported here by giantess maids! It seems that this planet was visited by a group of Titan giantesses several years ago. These giantesses, wearing maid uniforms and reaching heights of over ten kilometers, started planning and managing the cities on the planet as they pleased. From building cities to city transport to city clean-up, the giantess maids could do it all. Every day, giantess maids would walk across the continent carrying cities, stacking city upon city, and flattening cities with the soles of their feet. And the people in the cities could only endure all of this. The maids ignored their protests and resistance. However, these maids did not seem to be good at these \"chores.\" Accidents happened daily; for instance, a city might have been accidentally toppled, or a country might have been flattened because a maid did not pay attention to where she was walking. Eventually, the planet became a dead zone. The maids were still practicing city building and management, but there was no one left to inspect the work, and later, the maids also left, and everything fell silent."

  gts_lottie_site.5.A: "That's a pity, let's continue investigating"
  gts_lottie_site.4.name: "Inside the High Wall"
  gts_lottie_site.4.desc: "The team that climbed the wall reached the other side. As we expected, behind the wall is an enclosed area. The team members rappelled to the ground. Here is a large slope, seemingly covered by a beige carpet. The high walls around are brown, and the slope extends into the distance until it reaches the wall on the other side. At the bottom of the slope is a semi-enclosed space. Unlike the open sky here, there is a ceiling sheltering it, and a huge beam spans across the tops of the two high walls. However, the entire lower area is shrouded by increasingly dense fog. The captain determines that it does not look like a shelter, rather, it resembles a religious place, or some kind of large auditorium. If we want to investigate anything, it should be in the \"auditorium\" at the end of this slope."

  gts_lottie_site.4.A: "Proceed cautiously"
  gts_lottie_site.6.name: "Inside the \"Auditorium\""
  gts_lottie_site.6.desc: "As the team members walked down the slope and entered the mist, the team on the outside of the high wall also found the planet's archive, and read the information inside. Contrary to our expectations, there was evidence of civilization activity on this planet until a few decades ago, with the last message being recorded 16 years ago. Even though the planet’s ecosystem was destroyed centuries ago, there seems to be a number of residents living in a shelter. In this last message, the refuge experienced its end due to the aging of the life support system. In the last words of the residents, they all expressed their gratitude to an individual named \"Lottie\". Perhaps this was their leader. At this time, the team inside the high wall sent back unsettling reports. After stepping into the mist, they found that the environmental temperature was rising. Also, analysis of the fog composition showed that although it is somewhat toxic, it contains large amounts of water vapor, oxygen, and even some organic components, which clearly do not match the toxic atmosphere of the external planet. Finally, when they were about to reach the ceiling, we found the remains of the residents of this planet - or rather, part of the remains - a shriveled skin, tightly attached to the ground, and the lower half has disappeared. Judging from the state of the remains, they seem to have been crushed to death. Further investigations revealed more similar remains, and even many household items for living. All of them had been flattened without exception. “Maybe because of this long slope,” the captain examined the nearby remains. “Something must have rolled off the slope, miserable guys.” Finally, the team reached the bottom of the slope. The ground has now become flat, and due to the closed-off sky, it has become incredibly dark. “Captain! Take a look at this,” a team member called out, “the air pressure, temperature, and air composition here have all met the life-support standards.” It's very strange that everything on the surface here has been flattened, without any life support system running, but the environment here is suitable for survival. A daring team member removed his power suit helmet, and tentatively took a breath, \"Hmm, it's indeed breathable, and it's also hot and humid... it also has a strange but familiar smell at the same time.\""

  gts_lottie_site.6.A: "What did the archives discover?"
  gts_lottie_site.7.name: "The True Face of the \"Auditorium\""
  gts_lottie_site.7.desc: "The archive team checked many more logs, and discovered a staggering fact from a many images. 'Lottie' was not a member of the local residents but a giantess maid! She has pink hair. The cat ears and cat tail features indicate that she is a cat-girl. The blue and white maid uniform seemed to be modeled after some game. Under the frilly skirt, she wore white stockings and brown Mary Jane shoes. She was extremely cute! The giantess is more than 8 kilometers tall. Even though she tried to serve the local residents, this careless maid always meant well but messed things up. The damage she caused was always greater than the help she provided. Clearly, this dying world could not provide her anymore opportunities to mend her ways. The other maid companions had all been evacuated more than twenty years ago, leaving her here alone. The last resident died 16 years ago, but they were at least very grateful for the good intentions of this giant cat girl. But wait a minute! On this photo, the shoes worn by this cat girl... brown Mary Jane shoes... brown... the high wall. Everyone realized what is going on. “High wall team! High wall team! Can you hear me? That’s not an auditorium! Those are shoes that a giantess took off!” On the other side, the team in the auditorium also realized this fact. The humidity and temperature here are simply because the giantess had just taken off her shoes! Everyone broke out in cold sweat. This giant cat girl is still on this planet, and the team is in her shoes which she recently took off. So that means everything here that has been flattened was crushed by the giant feet that were worn inside the shoes! As bad luck would have it, the ground shook gradually more and more intensely."

  gts_lottie_site.7.A: "Retreat! Retreat now!"
  gts_lottie_site.8.name: "The Tallest Cat-Girl"
  gts_lottie_site.8.desc: "We realized the truth too late. Before the archive team could evacuate the building, the huge sole of the shoe stepped onto it. Accompanied by earth-shattering boom, half of the city disappeared under the brown shoe. Along with it, the life signs of the entire team disappeared - all turned into a straight line, like the horizon of this city. The high-wall team on the other side desperately tried to escape the toe of the shoe, and return to the ropes at the heel, but the over one-kilometer-long shoe would not give them a chance. Very quickly, the white giant thing slowly extended into the shoe. Who could have imagined that something bigger than a corvette was simply the “small and cute” stockinged foot of a cat-girl? The light gradually disappeared, and the team members’ hopes of survival also faded, and the team members who reacted have already started running in the opposite direction. Perhaps there might be gaps in the toe that would allow them to escape the fate of being crushed by giant feet. But they forgot that none of the bodies there were uncrushed. Communication was cut during a loud burst of shouting and the rumbling of cloth."

  gts_lottie_site.8.A: "Team, what's happening?! Team? Team!!!"
  gts_lottie_site.9.name: "A Careless Maid"
  gts_lottie_site.9.desc: "\"Eep! I didn't mean to! Please don't hit me!\" Despite being a giant cat-girl, she was now squatting on the ground like a child who had done something wrong, hugging her head. After the team disappeared, we finally got her attention through orbital bombardment. Using the information that we got from the archives, we successfully translated her language and began our conversation."

  gts_lottie_site.9.A: "Open Communication"
  gts_lottie_site.10.desc: "\"I, I didn't know there were people there... If I had known, I would definitely have avoided it,\" the cat-girl said with a grievance, \"I've killed people again, I always mess things up…\" Looking at her teary eyes, we temporarily turned off the weapons system that was aimed at her."
  gts_lottie_site.10.A: "You are Lottie, correct?"
  gts_lottie_site.11.desc: "\"Yes, I am a maid, working on this planet. I was brought here when I was six years old. It was already barren then. I wanted to help these poor little people, but their buildings always broke when touched, I took a long time practice to control my strength, but...\""
  gts_lottie_site.11.A: "It seems these ruins are all your handiwork?"
  gts_lottie_site.12.desc: "\"I... well... yes, we did it. But I really don't have any hostility towards them! I didn't want things to turn out this way,\" Lottie saying, starting to cry again."
  gts_lottie_site.12.A: "Why did you leave your shoes in the city?"
  gts_lottie_site.13.desc: "\"Ah, that's because when I was walking through here holding the city this morning, I accidentally dropped one of my shoes, but I couldn't free my hands to pick it up, so I could only pick it up after transporting it all. I didn't expect you to actually send people in,\" Lottie's face turned slightly red. \"I am really so sorry! I didn't know there would be people in my shoes!\""
  gts_lottie_site.13.a: "Did you know that many survivors have been crushed to death in your shoes?"
  gts_lottie_site.13.a.response: "\"Are you talking about your people? What? Not just them? Oh my god...\" Lottie pondered for a while. \"That explains why there's always strange things other than ruins stuck to my stockings, it's them... Is it because the warm foot sweat in my shoes can provide them with habitable places, which is why they are willing to risk so much and hide in my shoes?... They're just shy and don't dare to tell me, ooh... If I had known earlier, I would definitely have been more careful when I put on my shoes.\""
  gts_lottie_site.13.b: "Why are you still on this planet?"
  gts_lottie_site.13.b.response: "\"Because... the people in the shelter told me to find replacement parts for the life support system, so I found many cities, and moved them to the shelter so that they could look for them. But one day, when I got back from work, they didn't answer when I call them. So I kept searching and searching, hoping that I could still find some things useful to them. I want to hear them praise my abilities...\" Lottie wiped away her tears and gave us a forced smile. \"Lottie will be a maid that everyone welcomes! So I can't leave yet!\""
  gts_lottie_site.13.c: "Are you the only one here?"
  gts_lottie_site.13.c.response: "\"Yes, you are the first people I've spoken to in more than a decade. It's been a long time since I had someone to talk to, I'm a little...\" Lottie patted her face and said softly, \"No Lottie, you are a strong maid!\" \"Yes! But I've been working hard! I'm improving my skills! Although my previous masters are gone, I believe that there will be people who need me!\" Lottie looks at us with expectation."
  gts_lottie_site.13.A: "Then let's talk about how you plan to compensate for the loss of our personnel."
  gts_lottie_site.14.desc: "\"Eeee! I'm sorry! I'm really not doing it on purpose!\" Lottie panicked again. \"I, I'm willing to do anything! I'm willing to compensate you, don't give me a demerit, please!\" After hearing that we were from an alien nation, Lottie quickly said, \"You also have those small cities, right! I, I can go and help you build them, my skills has improved a lot, there won't be any disasters like the one on this planet! I will be careful, I will do anything you ask me to do! Please take me with you! Please don't… don’t leave me alone here...\" She was getting quieter and quieter."
  gts_lottie_site.14.A: "Okay, okay, stop crying, show me your résumé."
  gts_lottie_site.14.A.Tooltip: "\"Who wouldn't want to take such a cute cat-girl back home?\""

  gts_lottie_site.15.name: "\"Triumphantly Returning\""
  gts_lottie_site.15.desc: "We ruthlessly rejected the sobbing Lottie, and forced her to take off her shoes to compensate us. The giantess's shoes were full of foot sweat and many metabolic secretions. At the same time, the huge shoes could also be exhibited in the empire as a famous attraction. That's much better than a cat-girl who only makes trouble! Our ship took off from the ground with the huge shoes. Lottie, standing barefoot, stared blankly at the receding ship, and finally couldn't help but start to cry loudly. The crew members did not look back at her, maybe most of them were out of pity.

  gts_lottie.11.name: "The New Cat-Girl Maid"
  gts_lottie.11.desc: "It's been more than a year since Lottie joined [This.Owner.GetName]... Although this cat-girl governor occasionally accidentally crushes the cities she carries on her oppai, or forgets the new little person immigrants in her clothes, everyone on the planet is very grateful for the enormous convenience that this Titan cat-girl has brought. Therefore, everyone has prepared a grand performance for Lottie, with artists from all over the empire presenting their best works.\n\n§H\"Hahaha, what an amazing performance! Lottie likes it very much.\"§!\n\nLottie, who is squatting next to the theater using a magnifying glass to watch the performance, occasionally twitches her cat ears. However, while she was focused on the performance, her kilometer-long fluffy tail accidentally swept across a district. Hundreds of buildings couldn't withstand the huge impact of the tail's swing, and they all turned into ruins... But fortunately, everyone went out to see the performance, so there were no casualties.\n\n§H\"Waaah, I messed up again...\"§!"

  gts_lottie.12.desc: "It has been five years since Lottie joined our [This.Owner.GetName]! According to the tradition of the empire, every five years, the local governor of the sector will hold a grand celebration to showcase their governance achievements. Our kitty-cat maid also wanted to host a celebration that would satisfy everyone, but after hearing everyone's ideas, Lottie's face turned completely red.\n\n§H\"No, how can that be, I don't want to!\"§!\n\n§H\"But everyone's looking forward to it... What should I do?\"§!\n\nAfter some internal struggle, Lottie decided to meet everyone's expectations after all.\nOn the night of the ceremony, Lottie came to the central square of the planet and sat down. In front of hundreds of thousands of people from all over the planet, she took off her shoes and stood her white-stockinged feet on one side of the square. The white stockings of the hardworking cat-girl maid were already soaked with sweat, and the huge sock feet, being several kilometers long, tilted slightly to cover the entire square. The square becomes a humid and hot sauna, and large drops of water seeping down from her stockings occasionally hit amongst the crowd. However, the whole square instantly boiled over with cheers, and the joy of the crowd was beyond words.\nThe next day, the Titan Cat-Girl's stockinged feet went straight to the top of the galactic trending searches, and the place where Lottie landed also became a popular tourist spot and little people from all over the galaxy came to take pictures, making the tourism industry in the entire sector boom."

The level of happiness in the entire sector has been consistently ranked at the top of the empire.\n\n§H\"Although I like it, if it makes everyone happy...\"§!\n\nFor this celebration, Lottie prepared a special gift - her shoes!\nThe huge stockinged feet landed on the surface of the capital, leaving behind kilometer-long footprints. Lottie held her beloved shoes in her hands, and she was going to donate them to the empire. Since the last celebration, Lottie's shoes and socks have become the center of attention in the entire galaxy, and there have even been some churches that worshiped the cat-girl maid.\nAlthough we also want those shoes, we know about Lottie's difficulties.\n§H\"Eh? Is that okay? A new pair of shoes?\"§!\nWe propose to make a new pair of shoes for Lottie in exchange with her. This will prevent Lottie from only wearing stockings every day while going back and forth, and also express our gratitude to Lottie for her service, but more importantly, fill the void caused by her losing the cherished object."

The surrounding residents rushed to the streets, hoping to see the bare feet of the cat-girl.\n\n§H\"This is a reward for everyone for listening carefully, take it and use it!\"§!\n\nEver since taking off her shoes last time, Lottie has opened the door to a new world. She has fallen in love with the feeling of trampling the planet with her stockinged feet, and sometimes she would secretly let some bold people enter her stockings and then pretend not to notice them all day. Later, she gradually became dissatisfied with stockings and now wished one day to feel the touch of the planet with her bare feet.\nThe council members were also very concerned about this matter, and several ministers began to argue about the future uses for this pair of white pantyhose."

And Lottie happily accepted this gift, and immediately wore the toe ring on her toe. She lifted her giant foot and showed the toe ring, which symbolizes honor, to the capital's people.\n\n§H\"Hehe, thank you all for your support!\"§!"
