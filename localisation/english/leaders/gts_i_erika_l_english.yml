  gts_erika_catch_phrase: "Searching for tasty little bugs~"
  gts_erika.999.desc: "Wow, it's been about an hour since I finished eating the little bugs. Lucky you found me, or I'd be starving.\n\n(Licking her lips, savoring the taste of the recently consumed investigators)\n\nHuh? You're asking my name? I'm §YErika§!, dispatched by the Senior Research Institution, an explorer involved in interstellar expeditions-and, ahem, star exploration since like forever? It's been thousands of years, I guess? Then, due to a spacecraft engine failure, I was stuck on this planet for some time. Hehe, but thankfully, the little bugs on this planet are friendly and quite delicious~ Although, they love fighting with each other a lot."
  gts_erika.999.a: "It must have been tough for you, Explorer Erika, would you be willing to visit our nation?"
  gts_erika.999.a.response: "Sure, although this place is wonderful, it doesn't compare to the hustle and bustle of civilized society, plus there aren't any tinies to eat anymore.\nWhen we get back, you'd better treat me to a proper meal~"
  gts_erika.999.b: "Our investigators say you ate everyone on the entire planet? Isn't that a bit terrifying?"
  gts_erika.999.b.response: "Well, the inhabitants here had this strange wish to be swallowed by me~ I devoured each one with gratitude, digesting them.\nBesides, aren't tinies supposed to be food for giantesses?"
  gts_erika.999.c: "How do the tinies on this planet taste? How do they compare to our tinies?"
  gts_erika.999.c.response: "Hmm, I'm into gulping whole, unlike those who have their teeth stuck with tinies' bones! So, I can't speak much on the flavor of flesh. However, the people here cater to my eating habits, focusing heavily on the softness of their bodies and firmness of their muscles, some even dipping themselves fully in syrup~ Many would even massage my stomach walls from the inside, hehe.\nGranted, I actually enjoy the feeling of tinies struggling in my belly. Personally, I think every tiny is equally tasty and I'll eat them with gratitude, allowing them to nourish my body~"

  gts_erika_digsite_desc: "While roving through the stars, a research ship unexpectedly detected a humanoid-constructed megacity on the only habitable planet of this star system, remarkably similar to human cities. The research team immediately dispatched personnel to the planet for contact and investigation.\nInitially thinking they'd discover a new civilization, they arrived at the outskirts only to find the city deserted for unknown reasons. To uncover the whereabouts of the city's former residents, the research ship organized the data samples found and uploaded them to HQ, requesting further action orders."

  gts_erika.1000.name: "Ancient and Future"
  gts_erika.1000.desc: "While roving the stars, a research ship unexpectedly detected a megacity built by humanoid beings, remarkably similar to human cities, on the only habitable planet in this star system. The research team immediately dispatched personnel to the planet for contact and investigation.\nInitially thinking they'd discover a new civilization, they arrived at the outskirts only to find the city deserted for unknown reasons. To uncover the whereabouts of the city's former residents, the research ship organized the data samples found and uploaded them to HQ, requesting further action orders."
  gts_erika.1000.a: "Have the investigators cautiously enter the city center and find out why they disappeared."
  gts_erika.1001.name: "Could There Be a Giantess?"
  gts_erika.1001.desc: "The investigators cautiously entered the city center, still finding no one, but a close inspection of most buildings indicated they were built with reinforced corrosion-resistant alloy materials. Although different from our materials, the structures had a similar design to our tiny-occupied areas-likely to prevent massive hundred-meter giantesses from cracking streets while walking or breaking buildings with their voluptuous bodies while turning.\nThis remains an investigator's conjecture, but the possibility can't be ruled out."
  gts_erika.1001.a: "Good, continue the investigation, we might discover more."
  gts_erika.1002.name: "A Sad History, Humans Never Learn"
  gts_erika.1002.desc: "Investigators found a landmark building in the city, possibly a historical museum, and made a significant discovery inside.\n\nAlthough they couldn't decipher the native text, wall murals and document illustrations allowed investigators to piece together recent historical events.\n\nThe natives hailed from a free human nation in the galaxy, arriving on this planet via decrepit one-way warp migration ships (murals indicate they were largely criminals and exiles?), later establishing a colony here. Like many self-destructive civilizations in the galaxy, old patterns of division and infighting led to their near-complete dissolution via powerful weapons, reducing their few cities to ruins before their global expansion.\n\nDuring the final stages of their world wars, a smoking giant spacecraft crashed into this planet's atmosphere, hard-landing in a city center and leveling it.\nFrom it emerged a large, green-haired human female with a ponytail, and the current investigation ends there."
  gts_erika.1002.a: "Is this a giantess? As expected, continue the investigation, we need to know more."
  gts_erika.1002.b: "Do we have any sisters who went missing during interstellar travel?"
  gts_erika.1003.name: "A Fork in the Road, A Foodie Giantess Descends"
  gts_erika.1003.desc: "The green-haired giantess's arrival seemed to break the unrelenting conflict between the two sides.\n\nDriven by hunger, the first thing the famished giantess did upon arriving on this unfamiliar planet was feast, indiscriminately placing everyone she saw into her mouth until her hunger was sated.\n\nThe warring factions ultimately ceased hostilities upon realizing her origin through conversation-her name was Erika, she had been on interstellar travels until a spaceship malfunction forced her to use an escape pod to land on this planet.\n\nThey attempted to halt her eating, to which Erika simply demanded they supply her with significant quantities of tinies as food and assist in building her a new spaceship to continue her travels, in exchange for granting their pleas and even assisting in their rebuilding. To ensure their species' survival, they reluctantly agreed.\n\nIn the ensuing years, driven to satiate her insatiable hunger, people rebuilt society while advancing their technology. This colony, once on the brink of destruction from war, saw miraculous prosperity under Erika's deterrence and aid-giantess knowledge propelled technology, while her fluids and excretions spurred industry-all at the cost of regularly offering tinies as tribute.\n\nOver time, the development of cloning tech allowed them to gradually use clones to fulfill her appetites, the clone production plant able to alter genetic codes to provide Erika varied flavors and textures."
  gts_erika.1003.a: "The superiority of the giantess race is proven again, continue the investigation, we must know more."
  gts_erika.1003.b: "Hmm... makes me curious about how the inhabitants of this planet taste."
  gts_erika.1003.c: "Terrifying!"
  gts_erika.1004.name: "A Sudden Turn, Clones Rebellion"
  gts_erika.1004.desc: "Investigators made progress, revealing the end of this civilization's history.\n\nThe planet's humans discovered that their race's revival stemmed entirely from the giantess's efforts.\n\nSoon, society split into two factions. Most believed they were inherently giantess food, offering everything was right. Others contended that humans, never mere fare, maintained autonomy.\n\nWar erupted again while Erika napped; a terrorist act triggered a mishap at the largest cloning facility, allowing many of the giantess's food clones to escape.\n\nSurprisingly, the war's result was that clones, solely desiring to become Erika's food, soon occupied remaining clone factories, assembling an army. Overwhelming in quantity, clones defeated both factions, capturing all humans and feeding them to Erika batch by batch.\n\nClones took over this planet, constructing this unique city and venerating Erika as a deity, eventually expending vast assets to protect her, hiding her underground.\n\nThe hope was to continue clone factory production, feeding Erika. Yet, previous gruesome wars had lost vital genetic tech, preventing further manufacture. Clones became food, slowly until this place was deserted."
  gts_erika.1004.a: "A touching, yet inexplicable form of 'loyalty.'"
  gts_erika.1004.b: "It's like a fairy tale-what a beautiful story! If only I had a planet like this to play with."
  gts_erika.1005.name: "Deep Underground"
  gts_erika.1005.desc: "Using city-found location data, investigators located clone production facilities and special metal materials near the outskirts, discovering an open elevator descending underground. The first team of tiny investigators attempted to descend but lost all contact shortly after. What should we do?"
  gts_erika.1005.a: "Continue sending down people; we've found a clue and cannot give up."
  gts_erika.1005.b: "Let those who went down fend for themselves; let's collect everything we can find on the surface."
  gts_erika.1010.name: "Erika"
  gts_erika.1010.desc: "The second batch of tiny investigators descended through the massive elevator to the depths, navigating long corridors before finding a large girl's bedroom. Experienced investigators immediately recognized it catered to hundredfold giantesses.\n\nAs they entered, they saw a green-haired giantess at a distance, sitting beside a bed, tossing several first-wave investigators into her mouth, enjoying her meal.\n\nInvestigators hurried to rescue comrades, climbing onto her bedside in vain; the first team had already filled her belly.\n\n“Burp.”\n\nErika burped satisfyingly, patting her full stomach. It wasn't the investigators' first time witnessing such scenes, yet fear of becoming food made them shrink back, seeking support from the research ship.\n\nQuickly, giantess investigators arrived underground, officially establishing contact with Erika."
  gts_erika.1010.a: "The sacrifice of the planet's natives and investigators was worthwhile, bring her back quickly."
  gts_erika.1011.name: "Erika"
  gts_erika.1011.desc: "A miracle occurred-just when we thought the investigators were lost, a communication signal from below reached the surface; one investigator from the first descent survived, briefly reporting what transpired.\n\nAs a harmful substance detector among investigators, clad in a Class A tiny protective suit, he described starting their investigation when Erika appeared. Waving didn't draw attention as she continued, obliviously stepping on a quarter of their investigators with her massive loafers.\n\nUpon feeling the slight anomaly beneath her feet, she leaned in to see more investigators below. Surprised, she turned with a smile, crouching forward, the wind from her massive form nearly blowing them away.\n\nErika plucked investigators individually, placing them delicately in her palm, then stepped into a massive room, sitting nonchalantly on the bed.\n\nSurviving investigators initially relaxed, thinking themselves safe, only to witness one of them getting picked up and casually tossed into Erika's mouth.\nIgnoring their reactions, Erika continued until they were all swallowed, stripped down in her undulating stomach, watched as coworkers dissolved, becoming a blend of flesh and bone.\n\nHelpless, the highest-protection investigator could only futilely send distress signals while witnessing and recording, as he was pushed through her digestive tract like food. Down to her large intestine, the suit torn, he could even smell the rancid stench of impending waste.\n\nFinally, he was excreted, alongside colleague-turned feces, into an opulent, decorated, immense squat toilet with a statue and prayer altar of a green-haired giantess-perhaps this was a holy site built by surviving clones.\n\nGathering courage, he returned to Erika's side and successfully caught her attention; Erika recalled this very investigator she ate, thus an extraordinary connection was formed.\nThis perilous journey will become legendary for tinies across the galaxy."
  gts_erika.1011.a: "Emerging from a giantess's stomach alive is rare-dispatch a team to bring him and Erika up."
  gts_erika.1011.b: "Being one with a giantess is an honor for tinies; fine, bring him and Erika back together."
  gts_erika.1020.name: "Erika's Arrival"
  gts_erika.1020.desc: "For the tinies within the giantess nation, Erika's return spells doom for those fearing becoming giantess food, yet for vore enthusiasts, it's heaven descend on earth.\nAs a venerable giantess within the senior research, her return has vore enthusiasts nearly erupting with ecstasy. Many across the empire learned of Erika's future arrival and spared no expense to reach nearby her landing city, hoping to become part of her plate.\nDisembarking her shuttle, her colossal first step inadvertently squashed a cluster of enthusiasts. Erika raised her head, seeing the howling crowd of vore enthusiasts waving her banners, basking in delight.\n\n“Little bugs, I'm back! Did you miss me?”\n\nSmiling broadly at the throng on the ground, Erika waved in acknowledgment.\n\n“Lady Erika, please consume us!”\n\nUpon hearing Erika's voice, the crowd erupted.\n\n“Everyone eager to become Lady Erika's food, maintain maximum restraint, keep order, leave a good impression on Lady Erika, don't…”\n\nDespite security forces holding megaphones to maintain order, sheer numbers overwhelmed them. Erika, surrounded by swarms of tinies breaking through every line, dared not step-concerned over the precious future food being wasted.\n\n“If everyone's eager to be my food… coincidentally I'm growing hungry on the way.”\n\nErika crouched slowly, above only a giant rounded bottom obstructing the tinies' view, setting down a hand palm-up, immediately overrun by tinies scrambling to climb aboard.\nHand filled quickly, those unable to reach caused a mild stampede, Erika gently took rioters in hand, without delay raising her hand to her face, Erica hesitantly parted her lips, revealing a warm, cavernous paradise to vore enthusiasts.\n\nWith one simple exhale, warm winds brushed over tinies, creating a haven-like euphoria.\n\n\"Let's begin~\"\n\nTilting her palm slightly, they dropped into Erika's mouth, the giant tongue stirring them, savoring each within her mouth.\nAfter a while, once satisfied, Erika gingerly tilted her head, the mixture of tinies and saliva descending, swallowed with satisfaction, visibly moving along her throat, disappearing into her ample bosom.\n\n\"Hmm~ Delicious.\"\n\nEncouraged by an expression of bliss atop Erika's face, more tinies erupted with joy.\n\n“Lady Erika! Lady Erika! Include me….”\n\nErika's inaugural day on her managed tinies' planet concluded with a fulfilling meal."
  gts_erika.1020.a: "Indeed, ancient research held mastery over vore."
  gts_erika.1021.name: "Vore Enthusiasts"
  gts_erika.1021.desc: "Twenty years into Erika's planetary management, global vore enthusiasts congregated again in Erika's arrival city.\nOver these two decades, planets experienced a fifth of its population consumed by Erika, yet enthusiasm continued unabated as enthusiasts traveled interstellar realms to partake in her rule. The population census noted tinies' numbers almost doubled over a decade, overcrowding cities.\nFor the twentieth anniversary, they prepared a grand gift.\nInvited to a fest sixty minutes earlier, dreamily stirred by giantess assistants, rushing to present herself neat aboard the ship toward the ceremony city.\nCoasting through the city, greeted by row-upon-row of cheering crowds lining roofs and streets, Erika dazzled by magnitude.\n\n“Master Erika! Happy Twentieth Anniversary!”\n\nAvoiding crushing the throngs in shielded streets engineered for massive giantesses, Erika, acknowledging supporters, gingerly plucked rooted tinies atop buildings, consuming grateful morsels.\nFinding herself at the city's center, instinctive bowel pressure surged as Erika recollected yesterday's meal.\nBreakfast comprised an impromptu roadside enthusiast gathering, an unfulfilling simple start, followed by ten-year routine of a 1,000 enthusiasts with varied sauces for lunch, accompanied by a 400-addon tiny dessert, established as realm reward. Evening's coastline relaxation saw fans feasted during nocturnal feast, appetite surging after prolonged hours of business concluding with around 500-tiny midnight snack, yet withholding bathroom relief.\nFlushed, Erika squeezed legs, thinking to wait until concluding the memorial, but the central square unveiled by enthusiasts revealed an enormous metal squat toilet.\n\n“Lady Erika, utilize here freely!”\n\nCrowd shouted as one, Erika gazing at congregated enthusiasts either side, seeing anticipation.\n\n“This…”\n\nStaring wide-eyed at the revealed porcelain, Erika flushed even deeper.\n\nThey truly made this, without even asking giantesses.\n\n“Quite something, they achieved this.. just for me.”\n\nErika pondered mortality, considering long-term supporters willing to be sustenance, finally succumbing, adjusting garments, approaching toilet.\n\n“Pervs, witness this, my first time doing this… in this context.”\n\nErika poised straddling above, shifting her skirt, lowering undergarments, crouching above the grand toilet, live broadcasts aired utterly captivated small cities, started relieving.\nGolden jets erupted, cascading waves inundated the massive bowl, enveloping enthusiasts in house-wide fields, followed by a gaseous emission overwhelming scent imploding throughout surrounding areas.\n\n\"Bloop.\"\n\nOnce gas discharged, massive fecal pillar intermixed with miniature bones squeezed, dropping onto prior discharge, heat enveloping, monstrous form.\n\n“Huff… so comfortable… overly accumulated.”\n\nRelief washed over Erika, a rare euphoria. Dozens of enthusiasts rushed carrying giant tissue, finest fabric.\nErika wiped, pulling clothing back into place, observing refuse.\n\n\"Ew, how embarrassing… grateful for you partakers, delightful bugs, farewell~”\n\nAmidst tiny cheers, Erika departed.\n\nUnbeknownst, the commemoration amplified not only vore enthusiast followers in giantess domain, but drew an attention tsunami from broader extreme-interest pursuers journeying interstellar zones to collide with Erika's realm."
  gts_erika.1021.a: "Hooray!"
  gts_erika.1030.name: "A Big Feast, Quite Ordinary"
  gts_erika.1030.desc: "Few giantesses would deign to bypass touchdown capsules before reaching a planet directly, but post-interstellar travel hunger left Erika few choices.\n\nPlummeting down meteor-like onto an intact city, impact quakes ensuing, local denizens initially recorded immense, growling hunger pouring from Erika's insides, followed by a green single-ponytailed giantess emerging from the cloud, her massive feet engraving crater-strewn roads.\nInnumerable natives and vehicles were flattened, entire constructs cascaded in her wake akin to toppling dominoes, Erika's focus homed on terrified inhabitants, consuming them one by one.\n\nWithin her own domain, apprehensive sparing valuable food by accident, yet on interstellar warfronts, deliberate destruction was her prerogative.\n\nQuickly, remaining ground defense units convened to intercept Erika, opening fire.\n\nUseless rain-like fire, failing against giantess resistance, served psychological comfort but little more.\n\nUnable to retreat space fleets deemed the ground force opposition waves delivering meals rather than salvation, armed vehicles burdened with members met the same fate delivered as mobile lunches.\n\nEvacuee vessels shared the same destiny, domestics melting into Erika's stomach amidst despairing wails, subsumed as specks of nourishment.\n\nUntil nearly the entire city transformed into belly contents, Erika shifted to the next urban zone, diminutive land forces landing as if to control refugees, encountered abandoned ruins.\n\nFollowing this battle, many local vore aficionados questioned why Erika would reward foreign enemies instead of herself."
  gts_erika.1030.a: "Spectacular!"
  gts_erika.1031.name: "Chosen of the Giantess God"
  gts_erika.1031.desc: "Planned operations began amidst urgent battle conditions, ground forces engagements more valiant than expected, organizing defensive perimeters around the planet's greatest defensive bastion.\n\nStarship-bound Erika, unable to descend directly while commanding fleets, watched her adept ground troops face setbacks, privately prayed for tinies' safety.\n\nAn ordinary tiny marine aboard a descending craft on Erika's trail, the giantess's worried visage observed through craft's window.\n\nUpon reaching the terrain, battle reality unfolded, unexpectedly resilient enemy counterattacks reported from wounded comrades, aligned with Erika's anxious demeanor.\n\nSupercharged anger and strength invigorated him, with a new offensive wave overwhelming, friends crashing, even flagging bearers downed, he-a medic-passed wounded off to comrades, surged to the fore, singly cupping the flag beneath perilous fire, charging enemy stronghold.\n\nWitnessing the flag ascend atop hostile domain spurred tiny marines instantly, shattering strongholds, though now mortally wounded, tenaciously clung, flag unwavering.\n\nDistinguished throughout recent battles for this bravery, his tale revered throughout the giantess empire by countless tinies, acclaimed by galaxy warrior giantesses.\n\nTop medics aboard star fleets spent days preserving his surviving life within vegetative states, employing neural links to convey his dying wish: become Erika's meal, bestowing remaining self to aide.\n\nHearing such a wish, Erika obliged, honoring the warrior's valor, Erika's sole breakfast singularly prepared towards his offering.\n\nPre-dawn doctors injected special substances ensuring golden hues preserved skeletal remains.\n\nEmbraced within Erika's potent oral caress, gently urged into depths, he seemed enroute towards paradise.\n\nDaylight saw minuscule caregivers retrieve his golden cranium from Erika's commemorative deposit, advised to process into a skull ring, cherished in Erika's collection.\n\nIn subsequent commemoration, Erika frequently donned this ring, marking the valor of her diminutive retainer of old."
