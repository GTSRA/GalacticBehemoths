  gts_leader_trait_saratoga_d_desc: "Although Saratoga usually shows great respect for tiny people, sometimes she can't help but play with them."
  gts_saratoga.1.name: "Saratoga"
  gts_saratoga.1.desc: "A Kanmusu your size walks into your office. When her gaze falls upon you, she can't help but smile.\n\n\"Hello, Admiral. It's our first meeting. I am the Kanmusu Saratoga.\""
  NAME_gts_saratoga: "Saratoga"
  gts_saratoga_desc: "A Kanmusu utterly loyal to you, accompanying you at your size. Usually very serious, but occasionally playful (and cleans up properly afterwards)."
  gts_saratoga_catch_phrase: "Admiral, you can call me Sara from now on, okay?"
  gts_saratoga.1.a: "Ad...miral?"
  gts_saratoga.1.a.response: "Yes, Admiral. The unique existence who can construct us Kanmusu and lead us into battle. That is you."
  gts_saratoga.1.b: "Why are you a different size from other Kanmusu?"
  gts_saratoga.1.b.response: "\"Hehe, of course I shrank specifically to meet you. After all, compared to my real size, the Admiral is less than dust~.\"\n\nShe gently rubs her fingers together and gives you a meaningful, playful smile."
  gts_saratoga.1.c: "You won't do anything... inappropriate, will you?"
  gts_saratoga.1.c.response: "Saratoga immediately drops her playful smile and bows to you.\n\n\"Please rest assured, Admiral. I, Saratoga, have decided to dedicate myself and my life to you and your nation.\""

  gts_saratoga.1.hire_custom_tooltip: "§YSaratoga§! will join our empire as a §Hleader§!."
  gts_saratoga.2.desc: "\"Admiral, do you know what day it is today?\"\n\nHearing Sara's voice simultaneously from the communicator and outside the window, you break out in a cold sweat. The view outside the window is shrouded by the shadow of a body too vast to see the end of, high noon feels like midnight. Sara's polite, expectant smile on the communicator awaits your correct answer, but her fingers unconsciously twitch, ready to deliver punishment for a wrong answer."
  gts_saratoga.2.a: "Cr...Crazy Thursday?"
  gts_saratoga.2.a.tooltip: "Seeking death unlocks CG."

  gts_saratoga.2.b: "Of course, it's the one-year anniversary of our first meeting."
  gts_saratoga.3.name: "The Price of Foolishness"
  gts_saratoga.3.desc: "Hearing your answer, Saratoga freezes, her smile solidifying.\n\n\"Admiral... toying with a maiden's heart isn't a good habit~\"\n\nThe communication cuts off. A roar echoes in the distance, and the entire building shakes slightly. Experience tells you this is the sign of a giantess moving. Escape or resistance is too late. You can only stay in the room and watch as the world outside the window grows darker with Sara's approach.\n\nSoon, the thunderous noise outside stops abruptly. Sara gently presses her tongue against the building's exterior wall. The whole building lurches violently, throwing you against the wall. Before you can comprehend what's happening, the wall opposite you is soaked by Sara's saliva, and radial cracks begin to spread under the pressure of her tongue tip.\n\n\"Hehe, hearing the Admiral say that makes me a little hungry.\"\n\nWithout waiting for any excuse, Sara applies slight pressure with her tongue, slicing the building in half. Her massive tongue tip passes over your head, retracting with the upper floors. But Sara doesn't swallow it directly. Instead, she parts her lips slightly and plays with the wreckage on her tongue tip, showing the Admiral that even the planet's strongest structures are mere toys or snacks before her.\n\nThe fragile structure quickly succumbs to the maiden's play, disintegrating in Sara's mouth. The giant tongue descends again, accurately scooping you up and carrying you into her mouth. As Sara closes her lips, the space becomes pitch black. You can only helplessly cling to the giant tongue that dragged you into this.\n\nYour feeble struggles seem to further fuel Sara's sadism. The movements of the tongue beneath you become larger and more unrestrained. First, it presses you against her palate as if to taste every bit of you, soaking you in her saliva, each breath violated by the maiden's scent. Then, it lightly flicks its tip, tossing you into the air. Her control is perfect, letting you fall back onto her tongue tip just as the acceleration is about to render you unconscious. After you choke awake on her saliva, she mercilessly tosses you again. Finally, she pushes you between her molars, gently pressing down on your body until you lose consciousness under the dual pressure of mental and physical exhaustion.\n\nYou don't know how much time has passed when you jolt awake in your own bed. Outside the window, the orderly capital bustles as usual, peaceful as if nothing happened. As you doubt your memory, Sara pushes the door open with a breakfast tray. Seeing your confused face, she smiles politely as usual and places the tray by your bedside.\n\n\"Admiral, you're awake? Sorry for the scare. Have something to eat. Next time, answer properly, okay~?\""

  gts_saratoga.3.a: "Next time for sure."
  gts_saratoga.4.name: "Claiming Ownership"
  gts_saratoga.4.desc: "Hearing your answer, even the ever-composed Sara's lips curl into a slight smile.\n\n\"Admiral, I didn't expect you to remember~\"\n\nShe falls silent for a moment, then speaks again as if resolving herself:\n\n\"Admiral, you don't have a Secretary Ship yet, right?\"\n\nWithout waiting for your answer, the room's wall is shattered by a giant object that carries you into the air. Sara uses her finger as a boat, guiding you into a heavenly realm for just the two of you.\n\nThis is your first time facing Sara at her non-everyday size. Sitting on her fingertip, which carries a faint scent of sunflower oil, her breath brushes over you like a gentle breeze, the faint moisture dampening your clothes. Her translucent eyes reflect your image, and a faint blush colors her usually calm face.\n\n\"Admiral, this is my 'application'.\"\n\nAs if giving you no chance to refuse, Sara, before you recover from the shock, lightly lifts her finger. The maiden's warm breath and the exhalation seeping from her rosy lips, carrying a strange hormonal fragrance, wash over you. After a slight pause, Sara gently presses you against her lips and begins to rub slowly. She carefully moves her fingertip, allowing you full contact with the pink expanse before you, thoroughly coating your body in her saliva. Sensing no resistance, she tentatively extends her tongue and starts licking your body—like cats and dogs showing affection, or claiming ownership, staining you with her scent. Finally, the giant tongue slowly lifts you, placing you between her parted lips. Then her lips close, enveloping you in a gentle embrace, drawing a warm and beautiful conclusion to the night.\n\nYou don't know how much time passes before Sara reluctantly releases you from her lips and returns you to your office—or what currently remains of it.\n\n\"Admiral, I presume you've reached a decision regarding the Secretary Ship candidate?\""

  gts_saratoga.4.a: "Approved."
  gts_saratoga.5.desc: "\"Admiral, do you remember what day it is today?\"\n\nHearing Sara's voice simultaneously from the communicator and outside the window, you break out in a cold sweat. The view outside the window is shrouded by the shadow of a body too vast to see the end of, high noon feels like midnight. Sara's smile on the communicator is as proper as ever, but she then licks her lips teasingly, warning you not to repeat past mistakes."

  gts_saratoga.5.a: "Of course, it's the two-year anniversary of our first meeting."
  gts_saratoga.6.name: "Saratoga's Little Hobby."
  gts_saratoga.6.desc: "A shocking report lands on your desk today. The mastermind behind several recent disappearance cases in the country is none other than your new Secretary Ship, Saratoga!\n\nHeads of various relevant departments in the room watch silently as you read the report, awaiting your instructions."
  gts_saratoga.6.a: "I'll teach her a lesson."
  gts_saratoga.6.a.tooltip: "Seeking death unlocks CG."

  gts_saratoga.6.b: "What can we even do?"
  gts_saratoga.7.name: "Lesson Time"
  gts_saratoga.7.desc: "\"Admiral, what's the matter?\"\n\nAfter you state your purpose, the polite smile on Sara's face stiffens. Even at your size, she radiates a goddess-like majesty.\n\n\"Admiral, have you forgotten something~?\"\n\nThe moment she finishes speaking, you lose consciousness. When you wake up, the space you're in seems endless. As you wonder what happened, the space above suddenly darkens. A seismic shockwave and blast throw you back. Only when you land and get a chance to catch your breath do you realize it's clearly a giant bare foot!\n\n\"Admiral, remember now?\"\n\nThe massive toes wiggle slowly before you, as if warming up. Each toe is like a skyscraper. You can only tremble in their shadow, praying not to be drawn in.\n\n\"This is the difference between us. Although you are special, Admiral, that doesn't mean you can do as you please.\"\n\nSara relaxes her toes, then slightly lifts one giant toe before you. Long experience with giantesses tells you to quickly walk towards it.\n\nUp close, you can see Sara's foot is well-maintained, glossy skin without a trace of dead skin. Fine dust and beads of sweat make the toes themselves appear even purer. Whether Sara hasn't noticed your arrival or has forgotten your tiny existence, she shows no reaction. You can only knock on the giant toe to get her attention.\n\nBut you soon regret it. The giant toe immediately descends, pinning you down. You can't even cry out instinctively, forced to endure Sara's toe grinding you until you lose consciousness amidst bone-crushing pain.\n\nYou don't know how much time has passed when you jolt awake on the sofa.\n\n\"Admiral, are you alright?\"\n\nSara, sitting nearby, leans over to check on you. Confirming you're unharmed, she sighs in relief.\n\n\"You're just too small. I mistook you for a bug...\"\n\nShe says this, her face unusually red, likely ashamed of such a basic mistake. Then she leans closer and whispers in your ear:\n\n\"We'll continue the next steps next time~\""

  gts_saratoga.7.a: "Next time for sure."
  gts_saratoga.8.name: "Saratoga's Proposal"
  gts_saratoga.8.desc: "\"Admiral, look what this is~\"\n\nToday, Sara quickly walks to your side as soon as she enters your office. You turn to see several exquisitely detailed miniature warships on her outstretched hand, each smaller than her fingertip. The comparison makes you wonder if the gap between real warships and her actual size is just as hopeless.\n\n\"Pretty, right? This is... ... Admiral? Admiral~?\"\n\nRealizing your distraction, Sara quickly guesses your thoughts. She picks up a miniature and examines it.\n\n\"Eh, is this your largest, strongest warship? It doesn't even seem qualified to be my §Ytoy§!~\"\n\nSara applies slight pressure with her fingertip. The tiny warship quickly deforms and twists under the strain. She pauses, casting a glance at you, seemingly seeking your silent approval. You find yourself nodding inexplicably.\n\nWith your consent, Sara loosens her finger slightly, letting the miniature warship she was holding fall to the ground.\n\n\"Oops! (deadpan)\"\n\nShe puts on an act of accidental clumsiness and annoyance, but her toe is already slightly raised and precisely steps on the fallen warship.\n\n\"Where did it go? Really, it's so small, how am I supposed to find it? (deadpan)\"\n\nSara says this, but her eyes aren't looking at the ground; they're fixed on you. Confirming you've noticed the warship under her foot, before you can speak, her toe effortlessly presses down, crushing the pathetic warship, and she grinds it a few more times with relish.\n\n\"Eh? Did I step on something? (deadpan)\"\n\nOnly then does Sara leisurely lift her boot, showing you the warship already crushed into debris stuck to her sole.\n\n\"Ah, it's become unrecognizable §Ytrash§! now.\"\n\nShe then leans down and continues whispering in your ear.\n\n§R\"Just like your real fleet~\"§!\n\nShe stands up, sticks her tongue out playfully at you, then her gaze falls on a box of chocolate balls on your desk. She picks one up and plays with it, applying slight pressure with her fingers until its fragile shell cracks, leaking its internal liquid. Then she gives you a meaningful smile.\n\n\"Admiral, I think I can provide more experience in fighting giantesses for your fleet and your planet. What do you think?\""

  gts_saratoga.8.a: "Approved."
  gts_saratoga.1001.name: "Fleet Exercise"
  gts_saratoga.1001.desc: "Today is the day for exercises with Saratoga. You lead the fleet (under her strong prior request) to face Sara, who is a hundred thousand times larger. She casually picks up a warship and plays with it.\n\n\"Hehe, such a delicate miniature. Ah, I almost forgot (deadpan), this is the real thing~\"\n\nNo matter how hard its engines strain, the warship cannot escape her fingertips. Instead, under the squeezing pressure of her approaching fingers, the entire ship imprints the shape of Sara's fingers like clay. The crew can only scurry for survival in intact cabins amidst the maiden's amusement. Sara smiles teasingly in your direction and flicks the warship in her hand back towards your fleet, colliding with another ship and causing chaos throughout the formation.\n\n\"It's an honor to spar with you, Admiral. Please show me your skill.\"\n\nWith that, Sara reaches out towards your fleet again. You urgently command the fleet to scatter and evade. Seemingly not wanting to end it too quickly and embarrass you, Sara's outstretched hand slowly brushes past your fleet and withdraws unhurriedly, giving you ample time to counterattack.\n\n\"Doesn't hurt at all~\"\n\nSara laughs and stretches casually. Seeing her let her guard down, you decide to go all out, commanding the fleet to attack Sara's exposed underarm. Excited from teasing you, her body temperature has risen. Her underarm has turned from pale to an enticing cherry color. The attacking fleet must risk inhaling too much of the giantess's scent and dying from arousal, while also dodging various debris fragments she unconsciously crushes in her armpit amidst the hot, steamy haze. Even a maiden's underarm is an inescapable net for a human fleet; any unconscious slight movement is enough to bring apocalyptic destruction. Many ships become trapped by condensed sweat droplets, failing to withdraw successfully.\n\n\"Mmm~ Why so ticklish...\"\n\nDespairingly, your all-out surprise attack on Sara's sensitive underarm only causes a slight itch. But as the trapped ships are crushed and detonated sequentially in her closed armpit, the intense light from the explosions pours out from the tight缝隙, and Sara feels a somewhat irritating heat.\n\n\"Eek! Ad... Admiral?~\"\n\nSara lets out a coquettish cry. This attack, low on damage but high on humiliation, flusters her slightly. She instinctively wraps her arms around her chest. Seeing the attack work, you decide to press the advantage and attack the breasts lifted by Sara's arms. But humanity's most advanced weapons feel like gentle caresses against her soft, elastic chest. Only when the concentrated fire penetrates Sara's uniform and begins to刺激 the maiden's nipples does Sara, still trying to act unfazed, blush and let out seductive,魅惑 moans.\n\n\"Ugh... §YAnnoying bugs§!...\"\n\nLess and less able to control her rough, hot panting and the fragrant sweat beading on her face, Sara frowns, pouts, and scans the fleet before her. Then her giant tongue extends, coiling around your flagship and carrying it into her mouth, pressing it against her palate. Her tongue tip probes the hull, sweeping through cabin after cabin. Upon tasting you, she gently scoops you up and spits you out onto the majestic valley between her breasts.\n\n\"The Admiral must have been bewitched. Time to clear out the malign influences around the ruler.\"\n\nThe leaderless fleet immediately scatters. But a serious Sara easily grasps nearly half the ships with her hands. A gentle squeeze turns the empire's newest warships into two iron balls. She then flicks her wrists, scattering the wreckage in her hands towards the remaining fleet, smashing the surviving ships into disarray.\n\n\"Hmm... So much §Rtrash§! has accumulated over the capital. Let me clean it up~\"\n\nSeemingly still not vented, Sara opens her mouth slightly and blows towards the wreckage of the fleet before her. Her saliva-rich breath decomposes these sturdy metals upon contact. The weather across the continent changes due to this exhalation, creating a cloudless zone that allows the tiny people to clearly see the结晶 of their technology being brushed away like dust by the maiden's breath, falling into the atmosphere变成 a magnificent meteor shower. Finally, she taps your location on her chest contentedly.\n\n\"Exercise over. §RAdmiral, you only need me, right§!?~\""

  gts_saratoga.1001.a: "A general's reputation is built on ten thousand bones."
  gts_saratoga.1002.name: "Planned Exercise"
  gts_saratoga.1002.desc: "Today, the alarm blares at the [saratoga_exercise_planet.GetName] garrison command. Various monitor values go wild. The culprit is Sara, appearing ten thousand times larger at the capital of a small continent whose residents have been evacuated in advance—a size she told you \"won't make the tiny people completely lose the will to resist due to an overwhelming gap, but is sufficient to §Ycrush§! them\".\n\n\"Begin.\"\n\nAfter confirming the evacuation with the ground commander, Sara gives the order. The army arriving on the scene looks at their former guardian deity面面相觑. Even the sole of Sara's boot towers over almost everything in sight, let alone the boot itself or Sara.\n\nGrowing impatient with the army's lack of response, Sara unconsciously rises onto her toes. The resulting shockwave sweeps through and flattens several blocks near her feet, even overturning大量 infantry and tanks in the distance. This directly causes panic among the soldiers. Everyone begins firing their weapons wildly at the giant boot before them.\n\nSara first watches with interest, §Yobserving like insects§!, as the army pours fire onto her boot without harming it. But she soon grows bored, takes a step back, and removes her short boots and long socks.\n\n\"This way you should be able to cause some damage, right? If you still can't, then this unit has no reason to exist.不如 come be cleaners for my boots~\"\n\nSara's threat silences everyone. But this brief calm also allows the command chain to重建. The ground commander then orders the troops to attack Sara's little toe持续, until...\n\n\"Ah~... Ahem...\"\n\nSara lets out a娇嗔, trying to cover it with a cough. Seemingly somewhat annoyed, she lifts her giant foot to loom over the army.\n\n\"You did well (deadpan). After the offense drill, it should be defense and mobility drills now~\"\n\nThe army can only helplessly watch their sky be replaced by the slowly descending giant foot. Crushed cars and building debris fall from above. The occasional twisting of Sara's toes reflects her inner anticipation and the superiority of holding power over life and death. Surrounding buildings are the first to be crushed to powder. Infantry can only钻 under tanks to avoid falling chunks of concrete. But soon, the tanks are also pressed down by the giant foot, groaning under the strain.\n\n\"Hehe~ Feels like walking on a carpet.\"\n\nSara gently drags her foot back and forth, savoring the chaos beneath her. Only when satisfied does she reluctantly lift her foot—causing too many casualties would sadden the Admiral. Looking at the army stuck to her sole like §Ydust§!, Sara尽力 holds back her laughter and carefully shakes them off into her boot.\n\n\"Wiped out. As punishment, please clean and deodorize my boots~\""
