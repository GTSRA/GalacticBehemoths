  gts_huatian.999.b: "What are those flowers?"
  gts_huatian.999.b.response: "They are the genetic culmination of that bygone civilization, and the reason I've become so incredibly huge.  The ordinary me of the past was just as small and powerless as any common person, living every day under the shadow of those giantesses' footfalls... Until, one day, my civilization chose me as the executor of their plan.  First, they undertook a massive genetic engineering project, enlarging me a hundredfold, and then they planted these flowers upon my body.  They... they can continuously absorb the boundless energy from deep within that planet, converting it into my size and power.\n\nLater... the civilization on the planet perished... (Eyes begin to glisten) The flowers, symbiotic with me, continued to draw energy from the planet alongside me.  They multiplied and replicated endlessly, and I continued to grow, until... I reached my current state, thousands of times larger than the planet itself.\n\n...I know what you're going to ask.  Yes, if these flowers remain, I can continue to grow even larger.  As for where the limit lies... I have no idea."
  gts_huatian.999.c: "What is your name?"
  gts_huatian.999.c.response: "Me...? I don't have a name...\n\nWell... if you wish, you can call me Tiny HuaTian.  I know my current size might not exactly qualify as \"tiny,\" but... I don't want to forget everything I've experienced, or the memories of my life as an ordinary person on that small planet..."
  gts_huatian.999.d: "What is your goal for the future?"
  gts_huatian.999.d.response: "..................\n\n...Vengeance.  Though I don't know where the empire that destroyed my civilization is located, I don't know their culture or their strength, I don't even know if that empire still *exists*.  But since I now possess such power... I *will* avenge my people.  Those giantesses who relied on their thousands, tens of thousands of meters in height to cruelly and senselessly slaughter my civilization... I will repay them many times over."
  gts_huatian.999.e: "Will you join us?"
  gts_huatian.999.e.response: "Since it was you who awakened me... I can join you.  I also hope to find some new support within this empire."
  gts_huatian.999.f: "Where are our researchers?"
  gts_huatian.999.f.response: "You mean those little ones who were running around on my lower abdomen earlier?  Hmm... I can feel them, they're still on my body, but they seem to have gotten lost in one of my skin's creases...  In a little while, I'll return them to you."

  gts_trait_leader_huatian_a_desc: "This leader has traversed an unimaginable span of time alone. We cannot know what she experienced during that long period, but at least the knowledge she possesses is sufficient to solve many of our problems. In addition, her immense body itself is a very good research subject, of course... we need to obtain her consent first."
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_b: "Lover of Tinies"
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_b_desc: "Despite the fact that, due to her colossal size, countless 'tinies' are unintentionally crushed across HuaTian's body every day, this leader still strives to care for the 'tiny' individuals within the empire and allows those microbe-like beings to reside upon her body."
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_c: "Scourge of the Fallen"
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_c_desc: "Due to HuaTian's past experiences, this leader holds a very low opinion of the ancient empires that have existed in the galaxy for a long time, as well as the crisis creatures that disrupt the peace. Therefore, HuaTian is willing to use her massive form to provide a little 'convenience' to our fleets."

  gts_trait_leader_huatian_f_desc: "Deep within Leader HuaTian's honey pot lies a 'sea of flowers' left behind from ancient times. Under the influence of mechanisms we have yet to fully understand, these flowers, which have expanded along with HuaTian to the size of giant trees, can absorb all surrounding light and heat energy, converting it into Leader HuaTian's size. Although, due to genetic recognition, these flowers currently only affect Leader HuaTian, we have nevertheless established a simple research institute there to conduct continuous research, and we look forward to the day when we find the answers."
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_g: "Embrace the Past, Create the Future"
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_g_desc: "After personally destroying the shadow that once loomed over her, Leader HuaTian has completely devoted herself to our empire and our cause. Now, for our citizens, rather than a celestial-level giantess, HuaTian is more like a friendly schoolgirl next door who is full of hope for the future. It's just that this 'schoolgirl' will occasionally and affectionately loom over the planet's sky and wave to us with her immeasurably majestic hand."
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_h: "Boundless Flower Sea"
  gts_trait_leader_huatian_h_desc: "Now, the sea of flowers deep within the girl's honey pot has expanded considerably along with the girl's growth and the opening of her inner world. With HuaTian's increasingly skilled control, we can already use them to better develop the nearly endless resources within the girl's honey pot. And that fertile and warm world between the pink folds is considered by more and more citizens to be a paradise-like place of beauty."

  gts_trait_leader_huatian_i_desc: "This leader spent an unforgettable time in Leader HuaTian's honey pot.

  gts_huatian.1000.desc: "Upon landing and conducting preliminary scans, our research team discovered what appears to be an entrance to this structure. An ancient, alloy gate stands before them, leading into a massive corridor that has decayed over countless years. It is clearly the remnants of an ancient civilization. We've established an archaeological site outside the entrance, and research preparations are underway."

  gts_huatian.1001.desc: "The metal walls of this corridor are covered in copious writings and pictograms for alien races to understand.\nClearly, the civilization that built this structure foresaw its impending demise, and built this museum-like building to commemorate or perhaps something else. Based on information transmitted by the archaeological team, we've compiled the following account:\n\nIn ages past, the civilization on this planet was prosperous and flourishing, and after several technological revolutions, successfully developed a hyperdrive engine.  The entire nation celebrated, and the original inhabitants of the planet believed they would advance into the galaxy under the leadership of their empire, and achieve the happy life they envisioned. However, only after the first research ship equipped with the hyperdrive engine left the star system did they realize...\n\nThe first part of the account ends abruptly. Even we can feel the intense frustration of those ancient people as they left these records."

  gts_huatian.1002.desc: "The first research ship soon disappeared mysteriously in a neighboring star system. After calming the public, the authorities quickly launched another research ship. This time, the image that came back plunged everyone into even deeper panic. The research ship first encountered a white giant wall spanning thousands of kilometers. After several scans, the scientists were astonished to discover that the material of the wall was a special fabric with a strength that surpassed the current level of technology. There was another huge fleshy, organically textured wall that stretched to the horizon from behind the wall, and intense heat radiation was emanating from the inside of the wall. Unwilling to give up, the scientist decided to circumnavigating this vast object, until they discovered the truth: this behemoth was merely the white silk stocking covered feet of a Titan-class giantess. The wreckage of the last ship was tangled in the fabric."

  gts_huatian.1003.name: "Nightmare"
  gts_huatian.1003.desc: "As that giantess said, this civilization suffered humiliation after joining the galactic community. The diplomatic weight of their entire civilization was not even comparable to the prestige of a single giantess leader. Their people, even their cities, were transported to other giantess civilizations in repeated raids of trade trade, for consumption or even entertainment. Even their fleets were as small as small insignificant pests in the eyes of those shipgirls. Even more intolerable was the fact that a battleship they'd poured their entire national effort into building was casually snatched away by a passing Titan-class giantess to be used as a toy. Every moment, they trembled under the feet of those giantesses, and they didn't even have any effective solutions.\n\nThis situation didn't change until another equally ancient giantess empire declared war on them. And now, they believe it is time for revenge. Even if the ultimate fate is to be crushed,at least...they gained dignity."

  gts_huatian.1004.desc: "Time was running out for this civilization. The giantess Empire's land invasion fleet was rushing towards their small star system day and night. With a united belief and tireless work, a large-scale project based on their excellent bioscience began to be prepared intensively. For this plan, the government nearly exhausted the national treasury to transform the planet's topography, and demarcated this continent as the location for the implementation of the plan. Things went smoothly, and in the eager eyes of the people, the \"weapon\" that could change everything began to be completed. What would follow was a full and complete war of revenge.\n\nHowever, they were still one step too slow.\n\nThe giantess Empire's fleet suddenly descended into this star system after a warp jump. Giant girls, each thousands of meters tall, ruthlessly landed on the mother planet of this weak civilization. Even if they tried their best to organize resistance after resistance time after time, and the countless sacrifices that came with it, they has became insignificant in the eyes of those giantesses, maybe because the microorganisms under their feet was more conspicious, and the so-called armies and cities were just slightly wider gray carpets. When the giantesses rampaged through the city jokingly, using giant feet to trample, crush, and slaughter millions of citizens. Even the remaining fleet of this civilization was casually smashed by the Titan shipgirls who came with the giantess army. Endless despair completely enveloped the entire civilization. The last batch of scientists frantically and secretly buried this \"weapon\" at all costs, then surrendered, leaving only a chief scientist with an life at it's end wrote all of this on that corridor. The fate of this civilization came to an end.\n\nThe text on the corridor ends here. The final door now stands before us. With reverence for that ancient civilization, our scientists gently pushed open the huge door. However, the research team, who thought they would see all kinds of unimaginable objects and iron creations, was surprised to discover:\n\nAll that remains here is a sea of flowers."

Although there is no sunlight, these flowers still bloom miraculously. Obviously, the giant building we detected from space was to protect these flowers. Now, the researchers are still curious, and can even the final weapon left by that ancient civilization be these ordinary flowers? Even if they do seem to be unique products of this planet, that still cannot explain the reason for the existence of this garden. There is still a lot of space in front of us, and scientists are ready to continue exploring this continent-sized garden."

The blooming flowers rose straight into the sky in with the soil and the roaring ground, and another a piece of white land slowly rose from the earth, followed by equally snow-white giant pillars connecting to the milky-white earth, and countless silver and blue keratinous threads constantly scouring the earth. The team left on the ground was soon lost in this great change, and the small scientific research ship still waiting in space recorded everything that happened here.\n\nThe surface of this planet was shattered by the strong vibration and the squeezing of the huge objects deep in the strata, revealing the truth that had always been hidden beneath the surface: a celestial-level girl with her eyes closed, as if still asleep. In almost an instant, this smaller planet was completely shattered outside the girl's body, and the stratum material that once wrapped the girl was also attracted to the girl's huge body by the girl's own huge gravity, and finally became a ring of meteorites surrounding the girl's toes. The scientific research ship that had just completed emergency avoidance and performed an emergency scan confirmed that this celestial-level girl was the ultimate secret hidden deep in this planet. The sea of flowers that had just appeared was the location of the girl's exposed lower abdomen at. After the scientific research ship managed to avoid several huge strands of hair that swept over, it was able to measure that, but after this great change, the girl's size seems to have expanded again, and now it is even much larger than the planet she appeared on. What's more, The incident happened again: The girl opened her eyes, and after a brief trance, the huge water-blue pupils directly focused on the dust-like scientific research ship, and we still don't even know the attitude and information of this giantess. Just when the remaining scientific researchers thought they would definitely be crushed, we received communication from that girl."

The one below is just one of the many entries.\n\n...\n...\n\n'Oh, so this is that what the little ones call a city. It's so difficult to see. So, this is how the world looks from those前辈's eyes.'\n\nNext to a city of millionth-scale people, HuaTian, who is one and a half meters tall, or 1,560 kilometers if you prefer, squats down and looks curiously at the tiny people in front of her, whose city is barely the size of an A4 piece of paper. With the help of instruments, HuaTian can see those dust-like life forms in this city completely covered by her huge shadow, running madly in the opposite direction of her body. However, considering their size, how far can they run even if you give them a few minutes?\n\n'Crushing it should do should solve this,' HuaTian said with a gentle voice as she passed a death sentence on this city.

Below is one of many records.\n\n...\n...\n\nIn the brilliant universe, countless nebulae should have been operating in a disorderly and orderly manner, according to their own trajectories, day after day, year after year. However, a little while ago, the nebulae in this area could no longer act according to their own wishes, and all they could do was obey our great goddess, HuaTian Willowleaf.\n\nAfter sleeping for an unknown amount of time since her last sleep, HuaTian has finally woken up from her dreams, and reached out and lightly rubbed her eyes, not minding how her slight movement has plunged the surrounding starry sky into turmoil, how many civilizations and their galaxies have even been crushed on a fiber of her sleeve, and how many galaxies have been deviated under by a swing of her hand and even collided with each other, causing a series of unremarkable explosions. She just wanted to rub her eyes, and that was it.\n\nIn fact, if she wanted to, HuaTian could have saw the misery of those ones, but she stopped caring about these things a long time ago.\n\n'＊＊ ?'\n\nHuaTian opened her mouth, but eventually didn't remember who she wanted to call, so she dejectedly closed her mouth, and unconsciously held a few unlucky galaxies in her mouth. The aroma of flavor dripped, and countless suns were extinguished in one drop of a young girl's saliva in an instant, and the solid planets even skipped the process of being completely covered by saliva and turned into sludge and melted in the aroma of flavor. The healthy pink tongue is also hell in the night. Each tongue fur is several times the size of a solar system, and several airships of surviving civilizations are exploring around the tongue burrs, but they can't get other than despair parameters.\n\nHuaTian remembered that a long, long time ago, one of her favorite predecessors with a gentle smile who called her Master was granted the privilege to wish for a miracle. After talking with her, she made a wish to make her a goddess in this world, and this wish was indeed granted.\n\nHuaTian raised her head, and her dazed eyes tried hard to focus on a small galaxy with light purple light. Her soft long hair flew with thousands of nebulae, just as the memories that had already become a little illusory.\n\nShe recalled being wrapped in a burst of light at the time. Her body began to grow rapidly. Her mother planet, and the predecessor who was looking up to her, became fragments of the tip of her nose after fifteen seconds. The sun that nurtured all things only persisted for ten seconds before it went out beneath her white socks. But the wish didn't take hold. The unit of her height soon became light-years, then broke through the shackles of the Milky Way until the supercloud group was as small as gravel in front of her. She finally stopped.\n\nShe has became a goddess, and everything changes in the moment, and she has also become the loneliest creature in the universe.\n\nIn the first two weeks, she finally came out of the grief and confusion and wanted to accept get and getting used to her huge size.\n\nDuring the second half of the month, she tried to explore the borders of the universe, to toy with those star systems along the way, to feel the subtle stimulation of stars shattering, and even blushed with countless star systems to completed her first masturbation, which was her happiest time.\n\nLater on, HuaTian gradually felt a little greasy, and after the half-month-month-months, she would lose any interest. After all, how anyone can really care about something that they might accidentally suck into their nose, or even be shattered and dissolved on the hair of nose thing.\n\nWhat should do this time?\n\nHuaTian controlled the gravity in her hand, gently stretched out her index finger, attracting countless small spots of light to fly over to gather at her fingertips, then placed her finger in front of her eyes, watching the suns melting on her cold fingertips. Focusing her magic on her eyes, she watched the civilizations, low-level or high-level on the stars, panic to escape under the face of the universe in the alike meat color, frantically pouring out the most powerful weapons of her civilization, but even they could not reach her fingers.

Do it now...\n\nHuaTian moved her mind, the clothes on her body suddenly faded completely, and at the same time her body appeared in a star field with extremely high star density. The moment the noble and divine body appeared, those star systems instantly became noisy, and quickly climbed to HuaTian's nipples and clitoris at a speed which was too unbelievable for the celestial body, bursting and replenishing each other in large to provided HuaTian a little little stimulation. At the same time, each of the three points circled a galaxy ring.\n\nHuaTian rarely showed a smile. She gently placed her right hand lightly on the nipple and rubbed it. The engorged nipple immediately opened up the encircling galaxy ring, and a little milky material secreted, forcibly replacing the background of these galaxies with a rich milky aroma. Her left hand was also probing to the clitoris, gently smearing the already moist pussy with billions of hot stars, and at the same time inserting her jade finger combined with thousands of galaxies into the pussy, with force throbbing hard, her body was slightly curled up because of excitement, the civilization in the constant The amorously fluid dissolved, turning hundreds of millions of years of accumulation into the most humble dirt in the girl's vagina, using its insignificant life to please the great goddess HuaTian.

There were no signs of any intelligent life existing here. The expedition team found nothing but dirt and metabolic products produced by the girl's body in the patterns on her fair skin.

Although this has also brought a lot of difficulties for our expedition team, it may be a good choice to establish a power generation zone in this area. Of course, the premise is that the the planned 'power generation zone' can withstand the impact of a planet being hit when the girl pinches her arm.\n\nHowever, even though the monitoring equipment shows that there is every life sign, our expedition team still failed to find traces of the missing scientific research team. As a result, we can only turn to a place that has been deliberately ignored by us: the girl's honey pot.

You found them, did you...?'\n\nThe tense emotions swept through all the members of the team in an instant. . In the face of such an absolute difference in size, all struggles are obviously futile. For that girl, even just slightly raising her fingertips and then slowly crushing them would be enough to destroy everything here. However, soon, the girl's gentle voice rang again, but this time the voice It seems to have a little bit of... apology in it?\n\n'Ah, don't be nervous, don't be nervous, I don't intend to hurt you,'\n'I'm just, a little bit angry... After all, those flowers are already my most cherished thing and the last souvenir left to me by that lost civilization...'\n'Then...let's just treat it as a small revenge. Now, can we have a chat? It's been a long time since anyone has been willing to talk to me...'\n\nAccording to the girl's instructions, the team transmitted our empire's communication method and language to her brain in the form of electromagnetic waves. Seconds later, we received a communication signal from that girl."

Soon, she passed through the clouds and fell into a gray ruin..\n\nAyafala, who had returned to her normal human form, was already waiting underneath Xiaohua Tian. XiaohuaTian, who was originally far away, gradually became smaller. When she passed through the clouds, her height was only 100 meters, and when she was only 100 meters away, her height was the same as normal people. ``Wuwu... Little Sheep save me... I dare not anymore...''\n\nAyafala took a step forward and stretched out a hand to Xiaohua Tian. XiaohuaTian, who continued to shrink and fall, thought she would give her an and expected hug, but when she saw Ayafala's palm gradually filling her vision, she realized that she was still shrinking.\n\nAt this moment, Xiaohua Tian's falling speed slowed down a bit. Due to the effect of air resistance, the smaller she shrunk, the slower she fell. It wasn't until she saw that her palm, which made ever wrinkle on Ayafala's hand became as big as ridge hills until she suddenly understand, and become a invisible microorganisms. She fell gently into a ravine between the palm prints. The flesh-colored ridges on both sides that were difficult to see the top were daunting, and the cells she stepped on were only a little bigger than her.\n\n``Oh my god...'' \nXiaohua Tian laid and spread in those two cell, looking up at Ayafala's huge face on the hand which was in this space, she could only close her eyes, and from the celestial to the microorganisms. At this moment, she felt like a wandering explorer exploring the spectacular scenery on Ayafala's \"planet\".\n\n``During this time, just stay quietly in my palm...'' \n\nAyafala whispered, folded her both hand, Then, she was one jump, At the same time that returning planet, and to original she left this planet.

Special positioning devices to prevent getting lost on the giantess's skin as well as mass-energy conversion instruments that can convert sweat and dirt into food and heat have also been put into use.

Even the most seasoned explorers in the Empire would likely find it difficult to maintain composure while navigating this environment saturated with hormones and maidenly scent. Through the images and love-fluid disaster logs periodically transmitted back by the team members, we have gained a deeper understanding of the celestial maiden's honey pot region. Furthermore, the latest communication indicates that the exploration team has reached the miniature colony we established deep within Leader HuaTian's honey pot. After inadvertently destroying several cities, they have made contact with the microscopic people 'native' to this place, who are skilled in surviving within a giantess's honey pot, and have located the 'sea of flowers.'\n\nNow, the flowers that marked our first encounter with the maiden have grown along with HuaTian's expanding form, becoming a vibrant forest. After taking a few simple samples, our exploration team swiftly withdrew from this most cherished area of the maiden, returning to the folds near her honey pot and beginning their trek back to the returning transport ship.\n\nSoon, the team dispatched to explore near Leader HuaTian's honey pot returned after approximately half a year's journey. Although the team members' condition is not ideal, and they all appear quite exhausted, at least none of them were left behind forever in the depths of the celestial maiden's honey pot, erased in an instant by the planet-like pink walls of flesh, as have countless tiny individuals inadvertently or intentionally consumed upon her body. Moreover, thanks to the analysis of the research personnel, we have obtained vital data and theories, which will greatly benefit the Empire's ancient biology reserves.

Whether it's the execution of hostile planets or fleets, or the giantess transformation of domestic colonies, the gentle maiden has used her slender, fair silk stockinged feet to complete 'difficult' tasks for us time and time again. At the same time, the citizens of the Empire have also felt the concern from Leader HuaTian; compared to the oppressive force that other celestial giantesses seem to be forever unable to overcome, our citizens seem more willing to affectionately address her by her given name, rather than a trembling 'Lord God' uttered in humility and helplessness.\nHowever, recently, we seem to have observed some unusual behavior in Leader HuaTian. In her spare time without missions, the maiden, who often becomes depressed, always floats silently in the boundless universe, quietly gazing in the same direction near the orbits of a few tiny planets. Although such details would not be too noticeable in any ordinary maiden, Leader HuaTian is, after all, a celestial giantess. Even a very slight difference can cause serious 'natural disasters' on her body surface colonies, thus alerting us to this anomaly. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conduct a more in-depth investigation in order to find out the reasons behind this."

However, when we cautiously worded our questions and tried to ask her directly, the maiden, who didn't seem very enthusiastic, just responded softly, then gently turned around and floated to the other side of the star as large as her, leaving [Root.capital.GetName], enveloped by her voice, behind. It seems that if we cannot resolve her inner knot, ordinary communication will no longer work.\n\nTherefore, after unsuccessful communication, the scientific research team who usually 'accompanies' Scientific Officer HuaTian and the Empire's devotees of the maiden jointly proposed another solution: by observing the directions that Leader HuaTian unconsciously gazes towards at different times, calculate and locate a spatial coordinate in the star system. Soon, with the help of these dedicated citizens, we obtained this coordinate; and when we sent a small scientific research vessel to investigate, the scene that appeared before our eyes stunned everyone present: it was actually a star system floating quietly! There were even several terrestrial planets orbiting a star in the upper segment of the main sequence!\n\nSubsequently, our preliminary investigation revealed that this star system has a quite long history, but its surrounding hyperdrive routes have been completely destroyed, which is why neither we nor our predecessors discovered it and marked it on the navigable star chart. However, thanks to our ever-growing research level, we are now able to repair this hyperdrive route directly connected to the star system code-named 'HuaTian' and enter it to investigate. Considering that this place is extremely close to the star system where we first encountered Leader HuaTian, we believe that the history and truth existing here are very likely to help us resolve Leader HuaTian's inner knot."

Has there ever been a civilization here where giantesses and microscopic people coexisted in harmony?\n\nWith such doubts, the scientific research team took a large number of samples from the building complexes ranging from a hundred times larger to one-hundredth the size of normal people nearby, but whether it was their materials or craftsmanship, they were similar to the ancient buildings that our empire had excavated before, except that the smaller the houses, the less corroded they were.

The treasures of various worlds were displayed in the center of the empire. During its heyday, the empire even occupied most of the star system. Everyone believed that their civilization and empire would continue for thousands of generations, until the end of time.\n\nHowever, the empire's prosperity disappeared after a natural disaster called 'divine punishment'. A reckless quasi-stellar-class giantess broke into this small star system. The maiden, who completely ignored the tiny civilization existing here, floated around the black hole in the center of the star system for a few laps in confusion, and then very disappointedly pinched a few stars as souvenirs and left the star system in another direction. The despair and destruction that these ordinary and short-lived actions brought to the empire is conceivable: the eternal night that has never changed was shrouded by the maiden's fair body, and planets full of population crashed into the maiden's vast and delicate body like garbage at will. The gently drooping skirt set off the most violent cosmic storms in the star system. The strong maiden aura almost completely replaced the atmosphere that once existed in space, and the prosperous capital also turned into a pool of sparkling magma on the maiden's thighs.\n\nSubsequently, the ensuing resistance completely overthrew this empire. Other civilizations ranging from the meter-level to the micrometer-level, taking advantage of this opportunity, disintegrated the rule of the empire from the inside out after occupying and seizing a large number of giantess hormones hidden by the empire. The only remaining survivors risked being discovered and shrunk by maidens of other races and gathered in this star system, and used the last reserves of energy of the empire on the remaining colonies to destroy the hyperdrive routes here, hoping to continue to survive here with great luck. However, the planet resources here were completely insufficient to supply the consumption of those Titan-class giantesses, so they had to shrink their own size again and again in order to adapt to life here, which also created the buildings of varying sizes that we saw on the surface and in the corridors. And the descendants of those former 'giantesses' are now located in front of [root.leader.GetName]'s feet, and perhaps added together they are not enough to fill [root.leader.GetName]'s insole. Now, the civilization scattered on the surface and deep in the stratum has reached the verge of collapse."

  gts_huatian.1074.desc: "Upon receiving the leader's message, [root.leader.GetName] issued the order to return. However, just as our team members and a few maidens who still wanted to play around here turned around to leave with some disappointment, an extremely faint psionic signal entered [root.leader.GetName]'s mind. This signal, almost completely imperceptible to ordinary people, seemed to originate from deep within her shoe tip. Having no choice but to take off her shoe and reveal her snow-white silk-stockinged foot, [root.leader.GetName] 'gently' 'sent' the tiny team member who had just entered deeper into the shoe, hoping that this dedicated maiden could go and find out what was going on.\n\nSoon, the maiden, covered in the scent of [root.leader.GetName]'s foot sweat, crawled out along the shoe opening. On [root.leader.GetName]'s fingertip, she described to us: the psionic signal came from the most powerful psionicist in this civilization. She had been rushing towards this side across the entire continent since our research team had just landed. Finally, before we left, she had squeezed into the shoe through the fiber gaps at [root.leader.GetName]'s toe and tried her best to establish psionic communication with us. And her purpose was merely to offer a tribute to the (scientific officer) who had been regarded as a god, in exchange for our mercy and grace.\n\nConsidering the backwardness and insignificance of this civilization, our scientific officer [root.leader.GetName] did not have high expectations of obtaining any peculiar treasures. It was only out of respect for the last vestiges of an ancient civilization that she decided to go to the depths of the continent to witness the so-called 'treasure'. According to the psionicist, this item originated from one of the many treasures plundered by the once powerful giantess empire in ancient times; over the long years, other collections have been worn and broken, losing all value along with the decay and demise of their original owners. Only that 'treasure' still maintains its freshness and brilliance, and even continues to expand its volume over time, emitting peculiar psionic signals beyond this planet. After a short walk, slightly piqued by a trace of curiosity, [root.leader.GetName], stepping on the ruins of several cities, crossed the entire continent, pushed open the last door, and stepped over the ancient threshold. And when the scientific research team saw the 'treasure' that people had been worshipping for so long with their own eyes, they instantly understood the true and final gain of this expedition in shock and realization:\nA sky-blue petal, as vast as the starry sky and nearly a hundred meters long, lay quietly under the dying psionic light source overhead, twinkling with starlight."

  gts_huatian_special_project_3_DESC: "The truth has come to light. The civilization eking out an existence in the star system codenamed 'Beyond Space' is the one that destroyed Leader HuaTian's home planet and her civilization countless years ago. However, the situation has now completely reversed: the once incomparably powerful giantess empire has been reduced to dust under the 'touch' of an even more powerful stellar-class maiden and is now in a desperate situation; while our Leader HuaTian has become a divine celestial giantess under her civilization's final plan. It is likely that her abnormal state during this period was precisely caused by that petal that originally belonged to her.\n\nNow that things have come to this, we have no reason not to tell HuaTian the truth here. A detailed report and archaeological data of local buildings and strata compiled by the subsequent expedition team have been completed and can be sent to Leader HuaTian's communication terminal at any time. However, as for what she will do to that tiny and fragile planet... it may no longer be within our control."

  gts_huatian.1075.desc: "§B 'Is... this the place...' §!\nThe light from the star was obscured by the maiden's even more magnificent body, her deep blue dress floating quietly in space. Underneath her milky white legs, her two silk stockinged feet, encased in uniform shoes, swayed gently, the waves they stirred slowly but firmly blowing across the planet's surface, bringing a faint, unique fragrance of maiden's feet that swept through the air of scattered settlements. Although the people here had known their fate since our research team had all evacuated from this planet destined for execution a few days ago, when those moon-like blue pupils silently appeared in the sky, quietly watching this tiny planet the size of a fingertip, even the strongest person would find it difficult to maintain a straight posture in such despair and pressure.\n§B 'Hoo...' §!\nThe deep-breathing sky-blue maiden tried hard to calm the emotional ripples gradually rising in her heart, ignoring the hurricane and rain mixed with bodily fluids her breath stirred up on the planet. She vaguely identified the coordinates on the terminal one last time. In order not to accidentally injure innocent tiny planets, and even more to confirm that the nemesis she had been searching for endlessly through time was right before her eyes, the maiden named HuaTian had actually confirmed many extra times; and what was driving her to still not take action was probably the last bit of shock and disbelief in her thoughts, originating from when she was still not even fully grown?\n§B 'Everyone, I'm sorry.' §!\n§B 'I will try to slowly, gently... bring liberation to everyone.' §! The maiden's usual soft and cute voice now pronounced a death sentence for [] in orbit. However, almost no one in the settlements on the surface could hear these words alive: some of the remaining microscopic people had been dissolved and assimilated by the saliva rain in Leader HuaTian's breath just now, and some had been stripped from the planet's surface by the gravitational field generated by HuaTian's huge body, and finally fell into the vast and boundless pink world on the maiden's lower abdomen during a flight and fall, until they were crushed to pieces by mountain-like fibers and sweat beads."

  gts_huatian.1076.desc: "§B 'Haaah... I hope, there are no航路 nearby recently...' §!\nHuaTian, whose face was gradually turning red, gently lowered her slender arms, and unabashedly took off her snow-white panties, which had become wet, in front of the entire planet, then casually threw them onto the star on the side, completely ignoring the wails of the fiery star under the soaking of her love fluid, reaching out and slowly pinching the two poles of the planet. The earth made dull sounds under the maiden's fingertips, and several streams of fiery magma gushed out from under the crust, which had been crushed by fleshy giant walls, but could not even fill one of the maiden's fingerprints. The fragrance of bodily fluids and faint floral fragrance completely replaced all the atmosphere on the planet, like its last dignity before destruction.\n§B 'Then, it's about to begin...!' §!\nThe pitiful little ball squeezed in the center by the white giant pillars sank slowly with the movement of the maiden's fingertips. The sky that the last survivors on the planet could see gradually changed from HuaTian's cheeks to her magnificent breasts, azure tie, and even the skirt, where every fiber was clearly visible. Finally, accompanied by the arrival of a violent hot steam storm, the maiden's honey pot, as wide as a stellar rift, completely replaced the last blue sky on the planet. Under the milky white, tight fleshy walls, the hormonal scent that gradually spread out eroded the sanity of every tiny person, and tiny droplets of love fluid, spreading little by little from the atmosphere, swept away the remnants of civilization on the surface.\nImmediately afterwards, HuaTian, who had been unable to restrain herself for a long time, gently licked the corner of her mouth, and slowly and forcefully stuffed the tiny planet attached to her fingertips into her secret garden. The vast fleshy walls tightly adhered to the rugged surface, and gently imprinted all the terrain into the shape of the folds in her honey pot. The gradually rising temperature, along with the secreted love fluid, dissolved the fragile rocks and mantle, and the underground tiny people settlements were also submerged and assimilated under the erosion of the gradually pouring in love fluid. In just a few finger thrusts, this pitiful planet had been cut into two parts: one part was forever trapped in the depths of HuaTian's honey pot with those survivors, and the other part was extremely lucky to be washed out by the torrent of love fluid, quietly floating under Leader HuaTian's hips, who was constantly panting."

We can be gratified to see that the faint layer of hesitation that once shrouded the maiden's water-blue pupils has disappeared, replaced by a calmness and expectation for the future.\n§B '...Anyway, anyway... thank you so much.' §!\nThe sky overhead was shrouded by a pale pink giant object. HuaTian, who had不知何时 already arrived next to the capital planet, quietly watched [Root.GetRulerName]'s governor's mansion.

In addition, HuaTian has mastered the method of sharing the power of those flowers with other leaders, and she is also very willing to use this method to bring a little 'convenience' to other leaders in the empire.\nHowever, compared to its charming appearance and practical effect, it is more of a most sincere agreement and deep bond between you and the maiden. According to HuaTian's words, as long as you hold it in your hand and silently recite the maiden's name, she will come to you from the other side of the universe. No matter whether it is a microscopic civilization or a stellar-class giantess blocking the path of the empire, she will stand up for you."

She is now quietly floating in the orbit that will not affect the planet, and her deep blue pupils, which almost cover the entire sky, cast a gentle gaze. Now, it is time for us to make a decision: which leaders do we want to make bigger?"

She seemed a little unaccustomed to the environment, steadying herself against a fingerprint ridge and tilting her head to look up at the maiden in the sky, who was smiling down at her. Although she and HuaTian were both leaders of the (player empire name)… the difference in size was simply too vast. [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName], now trapped between the fingerprints, seemed no different from a microbe on Leader HuaTian's fingertip.\n\n§B “Mmm-hmm, just relax~”\n“When you wake up… perhaps, the world in your eyes will look completely different~” §!\n\nAfter reassuring the tiny maiden nestled in her fingertip as much as possible, HuaTian carefully pulled open her panties and slowly inserted the finger carrying [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName] through a small gap that appeared. Gently, she smeared [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName] onto a small fold on the edge of her honey pot before withdrawing her finger and closing her snow-white panties once more. The honey pot world of the maiden returned to its pinkish dimness.\n\n§B “Now, pick a flower and crawl inside.”\n“Hmm… I recommend that lilac next to you~ It seems to be growing more vigorously than the other ones near you~” §!\n\nPerhaps because it was her first time being ‘used’ by another maiden, [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName] nervously swallowed. She patted her fair cheeks and decided to do as the celestial maiden suggested. Not without some difficulty, she climbed over two small folds, and then [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName], lifting her skirt dampened slightly by love fluid, gently lay down on the flower stamen. Enveloped by the petals, she fell into a deep sleep. Psionic energy from within HuaTian's body gently flowed into [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName]'s body, transforming her physique."

Tiny buildings surrounded her body, and the distant peaks seemed only slightly taller than herself as she lay there. If she were to stand up, those pitiful mountains probably wouldn't even reach her ankles.\n\n“Could it be… it really worked!”\n\nGradually regaining her memories, [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName] suddenly sat up, excitedly gazing at the scattered tiny cities beneath her. She suppressed the elation that swelled within her along with her size, and then steadied herself on the ground as she stood. Her ‘petite’ feet, encased in shoes, gently tapped the ground. Next to the colossal shoe-mountain, several fragile buildings had already collapsed under [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName]'s unconscious, minimal movements, crashing down onto her toes.\n\n“Is this… what it feels like to be a Titan-class giantess?”\n\n§B “It is, indeed~” §!\n“Waaah!”\n\nStartled, [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName] fell to the ground with a thump, her panty-covered buttocks crushing a large swathe of the urban area. A subtle sensation came from her groin. [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName], who had never experienced such a feeling, bit her lip and softly gasped, then raised her head and instinctively looked at the sky. Contrary to expectations, the blue sky dotted with white clouds still floated above her head, not obscured by the celestial maiden’s pupils or fingertips.\n\n§B “C-calm down now—we’re just communicating through psionics, right now. After Your Excellency dispatched a transport ship to pick up the now-enlarged you from inside me, you’ve been lying here all this time, you see.” §!\n“Then… where is ‘here’? And why put me here?”\n§B “The city around you is a long-abandoned, desolate district scheduled for ‘removal’. As for why… well, it’s naturally to let you experience what it's like to be a Titan-class giantess~” §!\n§B “Anyway, that city is left for you to ‘enjoy’~ See you tomorrow~” §!\n\nAfter the communication was cut off, [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName], once again steadying herself on the slightly trembling ground, quietly surveyed the tiny grey moss at her feet. A few seconds later, a smile crept onto [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName]'s lips. Then, lifting her slender foot, which cast a shadow over a large city block beneath her, [event_target:gts_huatian_growth.GetName] gently waved her hand and heavily stomped down."

  gts_huatian.1081.desc: "§B “Good morning~ Is there something you need from me?” §!\n\nLeader HuaTian, having warped into the home system upon receiving our communication, waved with a smile. Casually tidying the blue hair that had been ruffled a bit by the cosmic winds, she gently approached our home planet, her snow-white stockings casting a vast shadow over the western hemisphere.\n\n§B “Wu-eh? S-shipgirl?” §!\n\nUpon hearing our intention, the maiden, who seemed to become much shyer, instinctively raised her hand to cover her flushed cheeks. Realizing that this simple movement of hers seemed to have stirred up another fragrant hurricane on the planet's surface, HuaTian softly turned her head away and breathed a sigh, tilting her head as she spoke to us. Although HuaTian's reason for not using a communicator might be habit, the maiden's magnificent yet gentle voice echoing across the planet still brought “a little” fright to our citizens.\n\n§B “But, I don't have any combat experience, you know…” §!\n\nIt seemed HuaTian hadn't experienced her own sense of presence from our perspective. Compared to battleships and titan ships that the Empire poured all its resources into producing, even a slight wave of a celestial maiden's hand or a casual stomp of her foot would cause destruction and devastation that we could never hope to achieve. Thus, we had to spend a little extra time explaining to her the power she possessed… and, by the way, playing a few recordings of planets unintentionally destroyed beneath her silk stockinged feet as evidence?\n\n§B “O-okay… If, you are willing…”\n“Hoo… I'll have to be more careful where I step from now on…” §!\n\nHuaTian, her face flushed, lowered herself and hugged her knees, instinctively moving her left foot next to the home planet, as if comparing their sizes. The answer was obvious: if the HuaTian who had just joined the Empire could still sit on the planet like riding a yoga ball, then the current planet was probably only fit to be deodorant powder for her toes. Seeing that panic was beginning to spread among those who had half the planet's sky obscured by white stockings and brown shoe walls, we quickly contacted HuaTian again through the communication panel. After the sky-blue maiden, hearing our request, covered her face and shyly \"fled\" the star system, we could begin our plan."

However, limited by Leader HuaTian's immeasurably vast size, the endless metal continent in our eyes is merely a thin, fragile 'coat' in the maiden's view. Fortunately, the maiden's own pervasive fragrance, the sparkling beads of sweat on her vast skin world, and the even more magnificent maiden herself are enough to charm or annihilate any enemies who dare to land on the maiden's body. Moreover, compared to more efficient and enemy-subjugating 'execution' methods, traditional kinetic firepower is obviously not as interesting as a playful stomp from the maiden."

  gts_huatian.1083.desc: "Although the celestial-class science officer possesses extremely powerful computing power and unparalleled size, HuaTian still needs several research teams of varying sizes as assistants when performing research tasks. These incredibly lucky girls are often selected through layers of screening to take office, and receive direct protection from the celestial maiden. After all, ancient ruins and various strange phenomena are often very fragile, and even a casual touch from HuaTian is enough to crush those ancient buildings under the soft flesh of the maiden's pink and white fingerprints. Therefore, except when encountering various ancient threats that can be curiously held and examined in the maiden's palm, normal research activities are often completed by those girls who have lived on HuaTian's body for a long time and have been completely immersed in the maiden's fragrance.\n\nIn addition, the location for the construction of the research section also encountered a little controversy. Our engineers planned to build the research team's residence and workplace on HuaTian's toe rings, but both the girls and HuaTian herself objected. The team members believed that doing so would force their leader to frequently put on and take off her shoes to release the research team, and that frequently exposing the maiden's milky white silk-stockinged feet to cosmic storms would make the leader catch a cold; HuaTian herself did not want those girls working with her to gradually transform into tiny foot bugs completely brainwashed by foot odor under the faint erosion of foot smell. Therefore, we finally decided to build the research section under Leader HuaTian's swan-like neck, like a tiny necklace."

Thus, in various subtle corners of HuaTian's body, patches of gray settlements have emerged, living off the heat and secretions emanating from the maiden's body."

However, thinking of the little ones struggling to survive on her body's surface world, HuaTian still remembered to restrain her movements, stopping before she unintentionally damaged more colonies and tiny planets.\n\n§B “From today onwards, I can also fight like other shipgirls!” §!\nTucking back the blue hair that had fallen over her eyes, HuaTian cheerfully floated next to [Root.capital.GetName], looking down at the tiny us on the surface.

Many citizens were already happily intoxicated by this scent, and some little guys with less firm willpower even disregarded everything and began to masturbate beneath the pure white sky.\n\n§B “However, what do those shipgirl前辈s usually do to enemies? Use this ship cannon? Or…?”\n“Hmm… wait, I seem to remember…” §!\n\nThe maiden's cheeks gradually turned crimson as she subconsciously covered her groin. Then, as if trying to cover it up, she chuckled lightly and opened the communication interface with us.

 # Original: §B“呼……应该，就是这里了吧。”§!\n少女柔软的声音回荡在[from.getname]的天空中，雪白色的辽阔巨墙遮蔽了曾经蔚蓝色的天幕。已经来到了[from.getname]旁边的小花田低下头静静地注视着这颗对自己来说只有乒乓球大小的渺小行星，水蓝色的小球在白丝覆盖着的小腿背景下显得格外可爱。如果不是上面若隐若现的点点火光的话，她几乎无法想象居然有着数百亿微小至极的生命正卑微地寄生在自己胯下的小小星球之上。\n§B“虽然很抱歉……我的任务就是把大家全都碾碎哦。”§!\n§B“不过请放心，只需要一瞬间就会结束的。”§!\n丝线摩擦的声音笼罩着早已陷入了绝望的人们。尽管早在自己的文明与那个存在天体级巨娘的帝国开战时、人们就已经预料到了这样的结果，但是当一位真正的天体级少女的白丝足趾笼罩在[from.getname]的上空、丝线交错的乳白色大陆透着粉嫩的足底天幕半是玩味半是戏谑地展露着它的纤细与宏伟的时候，那种绝望与压迫感足以轻而易举地压垮所有人想要侥幸苟活下去的希望——即使那位神明般的少女仅仅只是完成了脱下鞋子这一简单的动作而已。\n§B“唔……鞋子就放在旁边的恒星上面吧。”§!\n§B“那、要来了哦。”§!\n无视掉了身旁在天体级制服鞋的压迫下发出阵阵悲鸣的脆弱恒星，轻轻地呼出了一口气的小花田抬起了修长的双腿，将水晶球般的[from.getname]小心翼翼地夹在了两侧的足弓中间，缓缓地合拢着脚掌。宛如大陆倾碾而下的白丝巨足逼近着小小的行星，来自少女足尖的热浪裹挟着“稀薄”的足汗冲刷着地表上仅剩的陆地。从地面上的视角望去，一瞬间上升了十几度的大气中逐渐凝聚出了几片覆盖了数座大陆的阴云，紧随其后的则是磅礴的足汗暴雨，无论是绝望的人们还是曾经坚不可摧的建筑物、在刚刚接触到少女的足汗的一瞬间就几乎被腐蚀到渣都不剩了。\n更糟糕的是，虽然平常的小花田还算注重卫生，但是连续在帝国疆域之外探索了许久的她一直没能抽出时间找几颗海洋星球清洁一下自己闷了好久的丝足，堪称浓郁的足味混杂着小花田体表的花香一齐替换掉了[from.getname]上的大气，侵蚀着幸存者们的心智。用不了多久，这里的人们就会被少女的气息彻底洗脑成只能依靠小花田的分泌物生存的渺小足虫的。明明少女的足尖还没有接触到星球的表面，这里却已经几乎不剩下尚保留着智慧的生命了。\n\n“轰——”\n\n小花田的脚掌“轻柔”地贴合了星球的地表，无论是成片成片的灰色城市还是数百万年形成的山脉都在一瞬间之内被少女足底丝袜的纹路改写。火红的熔岩从被少女踩垮了的地壳中喷涌而出，却连少女袜子上的一根丝线都无法烧毁。随意地用脚揉碾了几下之后，轻柔地哼着歌谣的小花田重新抬起了双足，一切地貌都已经在足趾山峦的碾压下被彻底推平，残留而下的足垢山脉、足汗河流与浓郁雾气成为了这里全新的地貌。\n§B“这样，就算完成了吧……”§!

 # Original: 这边的饮料刚刚准备完，那边的烤箱也恰当好处地\"叮\"地响了一声，而后烤箱门自动打开，盛着蛋糕胚的烤盘随之弹了出来，又有两只看起来就很高级的机械臂从烤箱右侧伸了出来，花田则不慌不忙地踩着优雅的猫步后退一个身位，用魔法从餐橱中拉出一只冰纹玉盘放到身前，正好接住送过来的蛋糕，然后又熟练地身体微微后仰后撤一步，一边从背后的架子上拾起一个看上去没什么特别的玻璃罐，一边为另一只机械臂让出空间，让其上的裱花机为蛋糕涂上奶油\n\n有人或许会觉得，小花田倾注着满满对主人的爱的蛋糕为什么会直接用机器来涂奶油，咱只能说，看了前面的宇宙特调，难道您还觉得这普普通通的奶油会是蛋糕的重点吗，而且，以小花田的身高，要是真让她亲自来完成这次要环节的话，可是要费上不少时间，还未必能做的这样完美，所以，作为三星女仆，花田自然会选择最优的方案\n\n那么，这块蛋糕的真正灵魂，自然就是小人的微型城市，巨娘的特供糖霜\n\n花田手中的玻璃罐装着的不是别的，正是各种颜色的万分之一大小的小人建筑，里面还有着相当数量的小人，这种糖霜其实有着显著的缺点，那就是很难给小人们伪造出正常生活的环境，以致于九成九的小人都在漫长的监禁之中精神崩溃，像没有灵智的低等动物一样缩在自己那一隅小小的房间里，或者像生锈的发条人偶一样在屋顶和墙面间的崎岖缝隙中漫无目的地走着，但好在，不管这些可怜虫多么没有精气神，他们的灵魂依旧可口，是合格的小零食\n\n而且其实这些小人的精神状态还有另外的好处，那就是即便是善良的小花田，也很难对他们生出半分怜悯之心，而只是将他们当做单纯的佐料，甚至如果不是因为主人喜欢，小花田甚至不想把这些家伙当做佐料，如果说其他类型的超微小小人有幸从容器里逃生，花田大概会当做没看到，最多脱下鞋子用丝足逗弄一番，然后便会留他半分希望，任其自生自灭，但若是这个瓶子里的小人出逃，花田也只会无比嫌恶的一脚将其踩死，之后还要好好刷一遍鞋子，以免这种乐色脏了可爱女仆的脚——不过当然，上述两种假设都未曾发生过，灰尘都不如的小人怎么可能在花田的管理下逃出来呢\n\n于是，花田直接拧开了盖子，然后飞到蛋糕上方，将这些小人建筑均匀地铺满蛋糕的表面，只在中间留下一块硬币大小的空白，在下落的期间，难免会有小人从屋子里被甩飞出来，和那些原本就在外面的小人一起跌进奶油的海洋中，七成被直接淹没，剩下三成则要么呆呆地仰视着如同女神般耸立于天穹之外的小花田，要么继续麻木而又漫无目的地在白色的奶油沼泽中蹒跚而行，直至死亡\n\n既然已经有了\"糖霜\"，那么接下来就应该添一点\"果酱\"了\n\n花田向着打开的盒子小手一招，一枚的圆润可爱的小宇宙便飞到了她的手中，与之前不同，这一次花田用的是最简单直接的方式，葱白的玉指在宇宙表面稍稍用力敲了几下，那近十万光年厚的宇宙壁垒便十分脆弱的生出了连纹，再被花田的两只白皙小手轻轻一扒便扩大成裂纹，可怜的微生物穷尽万年亿年都无法突破分毫的屏障，却再一个柔弱小女孩的手中不堪一击，若是被那些高等文明知道这真相，恐怕会直接选择自杀，或者立刻转信花田神教吧，不过伟大的花田女神已经先一步帮他们找好了出路，贴心的加注上保护魔法后，将宇宙源质倒在蛋糕最中心，又用薄片向外分出十字花图案，在阳光的照射下，到真有些像晶莹剔透的深色蓝莓果酱\n\n

 # Original: 穿越黑洞的小花田来到了一个似乎是卧室的空间，唯一不同的是这个卧室的大小让天体级的花田看起来都像是一个手办\n\"小家伙干得不错嘛\"\n花田回头一看，这个巨大卧室的主人，一只灰毛红眸小萝莉正对着自己微笑，手上似乎还拿着一颗星球…那就是花田曾经的母星§Y地球§!！\n\"想不到小小的宇宙泡里竟然还有这么可爱的小家伙，差点就把你们的宇宙当做下午茶喝掉了呢\"\n此时的§Y地球§!上，无数人看着天上那太阳般闪耀的红色眼瞳，尽管幼女的脸庞看起来十分可爱，但是在如此巨大的体格差下，人们仍然感到恐惧\n\"唔，好想把这颗星球塞进批里啊…\"\n花田怎么会让自己的母星被眼前的灰毛萝莉以如此屈辱的方式毁掉！为了朝夕相处的朋友，为了星球上的生命，小花田只能屈服于小萝莉的淫威之下，放下天体级巨娘的尊严，成为匍匐在她脚下的卑贱宠物\n\"请不要伤害她们！我…我可以当你的小宠物！只要不伤害她们，怎么样对待我都可以！\"\n作为天体级巨娘的花田，从来没有想过有一天自己也会变成卑微渺小的存在，自己的生命乃至星河的命运完全掌握在眼前的萝莉神明手上\n\"唔…既然这颗星球对你这么重要那就交给你保管好了，你叫花田柳叶对吧，真好听的名字，那么从今天开始你就是咱的女仆啦！\"\n巨大的萝莉用手指抚摸着花田的身体，小花田又害怕又兴奋，如果她能让主人满意的话，这颗星球上的生命或许就能保住了吧？\n\"是的…主人\"\n此时的其余的人们惊讶的发现这么大一个§Y地球§!竟然平白无故的失踪了…也许真相永远不会被微缩银河内的人类知道了
