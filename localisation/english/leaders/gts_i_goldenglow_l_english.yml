  NAME_gts_goldenglow_system: "Emerald Sparks"
  gts_goldenglow_anomaly: "Blazing Sparks"
  gts_goldenglow_anomaly_desc: "Our research vessel has discovered an unusual energy fluctuation in a star system; specifically, the system seems to be filled with some kind of bioelectricity. All planets, except one, have been drastically altered under this influence. Creatures capable of such immense energy output are rare even in the galaxy, making an investigation of this system imperative."
  gts_goldenglow.2.name: "Electrifying Currents"
  gts_goldenglow.2.desc: "§S[Root.GetName]§! has conducted thorough research on the non-natural electrical phenomena in this star system, identifying them as originating from an extremely large creature. Moreover, during the investigation, the sensors occasionally captured the image of a giant humanoid figure near the start, alongside sighting of pink and white filaments by the research team. Additionally, a large amount of unknown crystalline fluid was found on one of the planets, determined to be biological in nature, resembling the fluids of other celestial-level giantesses within the Empire.\n\nGiven the objective existence of size differences in this system, the research team suspects the presence of a rare celestial-level giantess. The charged atmosphere and filaments could be her doing. Therefore, to make contact with this invaluable celestial-level giantess, §S[Root.GetName]§! has launched a special project to unearth the mysteries hidden in this star system."
  gts_goldenglow.2.a: "Continue the investigation"
  gts_goldenglow_special_project_1: "Pink Giant Shadow"
  gts_goldenglow_special_project_1_DESC: "Our research vessel discovered the existence of a presumed celestial giantess in this star system. The altered terrains on planets and hair filaments floating in space corroborate this. We must probe further into this mysterious system to seek out this enigmatic giantess."
  gts_goldenglow.3.name: "Pink Giant Shadow"
  gts_goldenglow.3.desc: "The investigation into the celestial giantess has not been entirely successful, especially as she appears to resist close contact with our research vessel. Each time the research team catches the eye of the girl behind a planet or near the star, she gazes with concern at the research vessel, as small as dust in her eyes, before disappearing silently into the darkness. Our scientist is equally puzzled, for even a Titan-level giantess or a microbe race are insignificantly small to her, offering no threat. Clearly, other reasons fuel her apprehensiveness.\n\nNevertheless, some progress was made. Upon sampling analysis, the bioenergy in this system was found to originate from the celestial giantess girl, who inexplicably emits radiation. Taking risks, the research team clandestinely made entry onto the girl's colossal body, retrieving minute biological samples from a pool of overpowering sweat and grime. Genetic analysis confirmed that the hair and fluids from the planets and around the star originated from this girl.\n\nA breakthrough is needed. Through analysis and observation, the scientist believes the sole untouched planet in this system may hold clues. Thus, another special project is initiated to probe this celestial giantess's secrets."
  gts_goldenglow.3.a: "We'll uncover the mystery"
  gts_goldenglow_special_project_2: "Shadow Spark"
  gts_goldenglow_special_project_2_DESC: "Exploration in the code-named 'Emerald Sparks' star system has reached an impasse. Neither anomalies nor the celestial giantess girl yield fruitful results. Thus, we must examine the one intact planet meticulously to unearth the secrets lurking in this star system."
  gts_goldenglow.4.name: "Emergency Evacuation"
  gts_goldenglow.4.desc: "To the scientist's disappointment, this planet held no special features. Neither terrain nor substance set it apart as anything but a normal, battered planet under giantess stress.\n\nHowever, as the research team prepared to reembark to the vessel, an anomaly erupted. A tremendous, indescribable sound broke through the distant horizon, akin to something grand approaching the planet, replacing the azure sky with a pink hue. A gargantuan entity moved overhead, obscuring all light. The research team stood frozen in the shadow cast by the entity until the scientist §S[Root.Leader.GetName]§! broke the silence with a trembling gasp.\n\n\"It... it's an ear!\"\n\nNo words could better describe the colossal object. As §S[Root.Leader.GetName]§! observed, the extent of the sky belonged to a fluffy pink beast ear, though its tip bent inexplicably. Quick comparisons made the connection that this part of the body belonged to the celestial giantess girl within the system.\n\n\"Team, retreat to the vessel immediately!\"\n\n\"Sigh... failed again,\"\n\"Perhaps I'm unfit to tend to those little ones...?\"\n\n§S[Root.Leader.GetName]§!’s command was overshadowed by another resounding voice, the entire planet trembling under the giantess's whispered self-talk. Despite seeing only a single ear, the scope of her body eluded vision, it was understood that a celestial giantess approaching such a delicate planet was unlikely to be promising.\n\n\"Despite being in an unknown universe, why does the Originium clutter still overflow with electric power...\"\n\"Anyway, let's use this planet to manage it...\"\n\nA deeper quake set beside the adorable voice, reminiscent of Death's decree. Flesh-colored horizon rose in the south, crossed above the research team, and crashed in the northern pole. Though it was merely a hand settling, the entire ground shrieked and tore under its weight. The mountains afar, leveled by her divine hand, left a wall of flesh. The scientist's instrument indicated an energy surge from the depths, her palm now an electric force charging into the earth. Soon, this planet would mirror others full of electricity.\n\nFortune prevailed as the research team returned to the vessel before the planet was crushed underfoot, narrowly escaping fallen debris and oceanic sweat droplets, slipping away through dangling pink strands.\n\nThe investigation ends in failure. One option remains: forcibly enter the celestial giantess’s body to establish contact using special measures."
  gts_goldenglow.4.a: "Begin the operation"
  gts_goldenglow_special_project_3: "Pure Glow"
  gts_goldenglow_special_project_3_DESC: "Investigating the Emerald Sparks star system reached its finale. We understood the strange planet origins and established one-way contact with the celestial giantess girl. Though we only heard scattered words, the research team's intuition believes she might be gentle. Through engagement, we might persuade her to join the Empire, ensuring tremendous prowess enhancement.\n\nChallenges are clear. As the largest star system presence, the giantess lives up to Curator assessments: destroying stars with ease. Engagement, hence, is rife with difficulty-her sway alone a planetary nemesis. Even her physiological phenomena equate disaster. Meanwhile, maximum-powered transmitters fall short of her ears, underscoring a daunting quest."
  gts_goldenglow.5.name: "Pure Glow"
  gts_goldenglow.5.desc: "After intricate calculation and patience, we landed on her sleeping body, nestled on the belly plains, relayed through §S[Root.Leader.GetName]§! images. All lay veiled in soft white mist, as if from evaporative sweat. The surface fused white and pink hues, regular tremors resonating with skin depth.\n\nHowever, this landing spot is unfavorably distant from facial proximity needed for communication signal dispatch. Relaunch entails risk, she may stir any moment, pondering her view on dust-like research vessels near her.\n\nDays of pacing led the research team to her fragrant shoulder, trekking over collarbone skin. The weary visage of §S[Root.Leader.GetName]§! bore testament, the journey tedious beyond thought. A fold in her soft body presented as planetary mountain range. Fortunately, proximity to her brain permitted scientific installation of a high-powered transmitter.\n\nA thin antenna rose from the pink and white landscape. Though smaller than her skin hairs, adequacy prevailed. Hence, under careful modulation, §S[Root.Leader.GetName]§! directed a signal to her planet-sized head.\n\n\"Huh? Who's speaking inside my head...?\"\n\"What do you mean... you're on my body now?\"\n\nAnother boom accompanied, the sky shrouded by shadow. Her soft and towering neck leaned down, enveloping the firmament, her immaculate face a universe-scale. Pink ears twitched nervously, intense eyes scanned shoulder areas, locating §S[Root.Leader.GetName]§!’s team. Whether she spotted minute dust-like team members, plans unfolded beyond expectation; a telepathic signal streamed from her."

  gts_goldenglow.5.a: "Establish communication!"
  # Leader Recruitment
  NAME_gts_goldenglow: "Suzy Grant"
  DESC_gts_goldenglow: "Naively Innocent Giantess Girl"
  gts_goldenglow_catch_phrase: "A pink girl joined us, let's hope she gets along with the tinies in our domain."
  gts_goldenglow.999.desc: "Ahem... hello! My name is Suzy Grant, or you can call me Golden Glow~ I hope under my management, every tiny individual in this region can live as happily as possible... provided their happiness aligns with my definition of 'happiness'."
  gts_goldenglow.999.a: "Why did you join us?"
  gts_goldenglow.999.a.response: "Hmm... maybe just for a better chance to interact with those adorable tinies.\nWatching those dust-sized species thrive from my mere goodwill is quite delightful, indeed~"
  gts_goldenglow.999.b: "Have you had similar experiences before?"
  gts_goldenglow.999.b.response: "Before arriving in this Empire, I governed a land planet with a native tiny civilization.\nInitially, I aided their country by setting up hydroponic farms and mineral processing stations. Due to a lack of resources, I used my own saliva and removed two threads from my socks to finalize constructions...\n\nUnfortunately, within their time, just ten years-or three months for me-their government grew defiant, even using chemically powered rockets against my legs... though comparable to dust mites, they couldn't pierce my stockings, and I was saddened... I soon left that star system for this Empire.\n\nWhat happened to that civilization? Truth be told... I was a bit upset, letting loyal tinies onto a lock of my hair, while the rebellious government vanished after a few casual steps, possibly rendering the planet unsustainable.\nSome lucky rebels may survive in my shoe's crevices, while my adoptees... out of concern for cosmic particles blowing them from my hair, I placed them in my shoe... despite the dark, they built an acceptable living using my bodily fluids and secretions. Would you care to see inside?"
  gts_goldenglow.999.c: "How will you manage our regions?"
  gts_goldenglow.999.c.response: "Presently, I want the tiny races to prosper harmoniously under my management... yet, to minimize crime, a prison planet for offenders seems prudent, housed in my other shoe or stocking.\nShould agriculture and industrial systems require rapid advancement, I'm willing to contribute. To tinies, even sweat can quench their thirst. Plus, to boost happiness, I could arrange tiny excursions on my body regularly. Judging by past small adoptees, tinies nearly view bodily access as ultimate joy~"
