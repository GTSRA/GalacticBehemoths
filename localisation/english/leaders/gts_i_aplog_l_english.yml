  # Apro Archaeological Event (New)
  gtsra_aplog_anomaly: "Mysterious City"
  gtsra_aplog_anomaly_desc: "Our science ship discovered some strange traces on the ground during a scan of a certain star system. Although the entire planet is covered with crater marks similar to those left by orbital bombardment, we can still vaguely distinguish the ruins that have been bombed to ruins. They appear to be some kind of city that was deliberately constructed. Our science officer believes it is a creation of some FTL pre-civilization used to worship and offer sacrifices to their gods, but strangely, there is no sign of any life activity in this creation, not even unintelligent livestock. Could it be that the gods they worshipped destroyed this place?"
  gts_aplog.2.name: "Destroyed Small Person Civilization?"
  gts_aplog.2.tiny.desc: "After multiple scans and sample analysis by [Root.Leader.GetName], our scientists have come to an incredible conclusion.\n\nEverything from the majestic high walls to the solid fortresses shows that the architectural planning on this planet is based on a standard fortress world model! But clearly, this once-glorious construction is now in ruins. Only some still-standing, broken fortresses tell the story of that earth-shattering invasion.\n\nMaybe we can still salvage some valuable information from within it?"
  gts_aplog.2.gts.desc: "After multiple scans and sample analysis by [Root.Leader.GetName], our scientists have come to a conclusion that they had long expected. The small walls and gravel-like fortresses all show that this small planet was once the land ruled by a group of small people. Although the architectural planning above is based on a standard fortress planet model, it is obvious that this land, which once wrote the glory of a small civilization, has become a ruin, perhaps from those still-standing fortresses covered in mucus, we can analyze that overwhelming invasion? Perhaps, we can still salvage some valuable information from within it?"

  gts_aplog.900.name: "Desolate Land"
  gts_aplog.900.tiny.desc: "Our expeditionary team is now in position as instructed. Surely this landing expedition will bring some warning to our civilization. According to instructions, [Root.Leader.GetName] will use the latest real-time sensing to complete this archaeological expedition. During the work, the daily lives of imperial science officers will be live-streamed to the residents of the entire empire, and it is believed that this decision will bring unprecedented influence to our country.\n\nThe air analyzer gives the planet a habitability of 75%, but according to [Root.Leader.GetName], the air here is actually filled with a strange aura that makes one feel terrified, however, some archaeological members say that it is an extremely sweet smell, and some even feel that it is like the 'smell of mother.' As a precaution, we have the entire archaeological team working in spacesuits.\n\nHowever, it seems that some members have shown a strong dependence on the air on this planet. After refusing our completely sealed archaeology, they took off their breathing masks, and looked drunk as they enjoyed it.\n\nMaybe it's a hallucinogenic component? More to be discussed.\n\nBased on several days of preliminary investigation, we have discovered that almost all of the buildings on the entire planet have been forcibly pushed down and crushed by some strange brute force. Some unreliable parts have even been deeply pressed into the mud, and even the tall city walls have been torn with open gaps everywhere. There are many unnatural pits everywhere. According to the previous orbital scans, we once thought that such a damaged masterpiece could only be produced by orbital bombardment, but now it seems more like the result of a certain Star Beast landing on the planet to hunt, or another more terrible conjecture… but our expeditionary team intentionally avoids this topic.\n\nBy connecting to the empire's database, the expeditionary team's electronic projector terminal successfully restores the damaged ruins electronically.\n\nWe have discovered that the original owners of this planet do not seem to be just one race, because different sizes of buildings can be seen in most places. Some of them are more than ten times larger than our buildings, and some only reach [Root.Leader.GetName]'s ankles. The expeditionary members spent a lot of effort to barely dig out some related literature from these ruins. We hope these alien notes can reveal the secrets of this fortress planet."
  gts_aplog.900.gts.desc: "Our expeditionary team is now in position as instructed, this landing expedition must be very interesting, maybe we can find some new toys.\n\nBased on several days of preliminary investigation, we have discovered that the small buildings on the whole planet were almost all pushed down and crushed by giantesses. Some unreliable parts were even deeply trampled into the soil. According to the previous orbital scan results combined with data analysis, we deduced that the destruction of these cities should have been done by a small giantess that is much shorter than us. Although less than our footprints that can easily crush the planet, the owner of these small footprints in our eyes is also an almost invincible super monster in the eyes of the small ones on this planet.\n\nBy connecting to the empire's database, the expeditionary team's electronic projector terminal successfully restores the damaged ruins electronically.\n\nWe have discovered that there seems to be more than one race of the original owners of this planet, because different-sized buildings can be seen in most places, but no matter how big they are built, they are just a step away from us. The members of the expeditionary team barely manage to dig some related literature from the ruins, which were almost flattened. We hope that these alien notes will bring us some fun."

  gts_aplog.901.name: "The Last Signal"
  gts_aplog.901.tiny.desc: "What kind of weapon could smash these things into the ground!? We even deployed demolition excavators to barely salvage a little valuable information. This...perhaps those orbital bombers used some kind of pure kinetic weapons; after all, similar weapons existed in our history...hopefully...\n\nBut regardless, after a period of archaeological work, the expedition team finally unearthed some valuable information on this desolate wasteland. These messages, akin to dying words, told us about the tragedy that this planet had experienced after translation.\n\nThe first message was found in a massive pit. Thanks to the protection of the fortress, this last words were completely translated by us.\n\n2290.1.1\nShe is here again.\nDespite making the most adequate preparations, despite being under the protection of high walls...\nI admit, I am afraid, there is no hiding it.\nFrom our leader to soldiers like myself, we all know in our hearts\nThat we have no chance of winning against that monster!!!\nThe high walls will be pushed over, the forts will be trampled, and even our minds will be looted by this monster!\nI still remember last year, my only friend, struggled and resisted, but was eventually captured by that monster. When we met again on the battlefield during the invasion last year...she had completely surrendered to that monster...\nI cannot forget the moment she rushed at me, naked and emaciated, brandishing a knife.\nSometimes I really wish I could die in battle by my friend's blade, rather than hiding here, fantasizing that some god could descend to save us from this torment.\nAh...\nThe sounds outside are getting louder and louder.\nThat's the monster laughing.\nThis time will be a farewell forever.\nMy dear, if I don't come back, please don't wait for me.\nI will bless you in heaven.\nPlease take our keepsake and escape this planet.\n\nNext to this message covered in blood and mud, was a small box that had been pressed into a flat shape. After a brief restoration, we finally saw its appearance: a dirty ring box, the base of which was as red as blood.\n\nAt the former capital of this planet, we translated the second complete message:\n\n2290.1.2\nI am...the President.\nEveryone, although I am filled with grief and anger, I must announce that our nation has officially perished today.\nCitizens, the no-fly zone has been lifted, and the launch center has been fully opened, everyone...please quickly board our last ark. Our scientists have discovered another colony suitable for us. If there are any survivors who reach there...\nplease do not forget that you are the spark of civilization, you are the continuation of civilization, you...are the last hope of civilization...\nOur army is making a final stand, fighting for every second of time for our evacuation.\nWith the highest respect, I express my deep gratitude to our warriors who fought until their last moment...\nLastly...\n...(Long silence)\nMay the Goddess bless us...\n\nThis holographic projection ends with the last sigh of the former leader of this planet, like a lament for the entire civilization.\n\nThe messages all corroborate the fact that we were initially unwilling to face. This prosperous and unified planet, this paradise planet belonging to the small people, has come to an end due to the invasion of those giantesses.\n…\nIn the huge footprint pits, the remaining limbs used their flesh and blood to create a picture of fearless charge...\nThe fortress built with the power of the entire planet, still uses its remaining structure to express its unwillingness...\n…\nOf course, we can envision the mocking smile on the face of the owner of this giant foot as she put down her foot.\nYes.\nAs simple as stepping on a bug.\nThe so-called rebellion and courage of the small people, in the eyes of those giantesses, is nothing more than bugs trying to climb on their ankles in vain and ignorance."

  gts_aplog.902.tiny.desc: "What? Why have our signals been cut off? Expedition team? Expedition team? Reply! Reply!\n\nAfter being out of contact for several hours, we finally received a weak signal transmitted by [Root.Leader.GetName].\nIn the video, she is panting heavily, constantly repeating nonsense like 'destruction' and 'support', and then turns the camera behind her. Only then do we understand the meaning of her nonsense.\nThrough the cracks in her hiding place, we saw the most unforgettable scene.\nA catgirl, or rather, a huge catgirl, is standing in the center of the ruined city, slowly and teasingly putting something from her right hand into her mouth.\nIt wasn't until she bit it down with her massive jaws, and the splattered specks of blood that made us realize that this purple-haired giantess was eating our expedition team!\n\nObviously, our sizes are too small for this giant cat. Not full, the catgirl smacked her lips, and then bent down to pick up another member of the team. Her purple eyes flickered, and without hesitation, she tossed the poor member into her mouth like a piece of candy. A few 'crunch crunch' sounds were followed by nothing but a blur of blood and flesh within her warm and moist mouth.\nAnnoyed, the catgirl flicks her tail impatiently. The huge pressure instantly blew away a ruined fortress behind her butt. The tail then gently curled around and easily caught those people shivering in the buildings into the air. This time, instead of chewing, the catgirl put over a dozen people into her mouth all at once. Her enormous tongue, like a mixer, thoroughly mixes the small people with her saliva.\n\nAfter about three minutes of playing, a \"glup\" sound is followed by silence inside the cat's mouth again.\n\n'Meow~ you taste good, it seems we are going to have some fun~'\n\nThe cat girl, appearing finally full, rubbed her belly with satisfaction and plopped her butt down in the ruins, staring at the hiding place of [Root.Leader.GetName] with a lustful expression."
  gts_aplog.902.gts.desc: "Hmm?\nAfter exploring for several hours, [Root.Leader.GetName] finally received a weak signal, so the entire expedition team hid together to record the approaching mysterious signal.\nA catgirl, or rather, a small catgirl, was standing in the center of the ruined city, slowly and teasingly putting something in her right hand into her mouth.\nEven though she is small to us, she is not what the original inhabitants of this planet would call \"small sized.\"\n\nShe picked something from the ruins, then bit it down. It wasn't until those splattered specks of blood make us realize that this purple-haired giantess was eating the surviving small people.\nObviously, this small kitty was still too big for the original inhabitants. The not full catgirl smacked her lips, and bent down to pick up another group of small people, purple eyes flickering. Without hesitation, she tossed these poor guys into her mouth as if she throwing bean candy. After a few 'crunch crunch' sounds, there was a blur of blood and flesh inside her warm and moist mouth.\nAnnoyed, the catgirl flicks her tail impatiently, and a huge wind instantly blew away a ruined fortress behind her butt. The tail gently curled around and easily caught those people shivering in the buildings into the air. This time, instead of chewing, the catgirl put more than ten people inside her mouth all at once. Her giant tongue became a mixer, and the small people and saliva mixed together.\n\nAfter three minutes or so of teasing, a \"glup\" sound announced silence in the kitty's mouth.\n\n'Meow~ you taste good, it seems like we're still going to have some fun~'\n\nThe catgirl, apparently not full, rubbed her belly with satisfaction and sat down in the ruins, staring lustfully at the survivors' hiding places"

It's just…\n\nThat faint trace of psionic reaction is, along with the catgirl’s blood, gradually becoming a part of her. From her soles to her hair, the souls that belong to our civilization are now pitifully becoming a part of this catgirl and are turning into slaves who completely obey her.\n\nNo, they still respond to our psionic call! We mobilized nearly every psionic in our planet and sent a wave of psionic shocks towards them, but all they did was slightly tremble with agitation, as if lamenting being imprisoned forever by the giant catgirl and reduced to an insignificance and completely lose their remaining will under the control of the catgirl. Apart from the psionic waves that still prove that they were once part of our people, they are no different from her cells now.\n\nIn the catgirl's movements, these cells, who were once research personnel, will gradually forget their original identity, completely become qualified cells, and forever dedicate their everything to the catgirl."

Their tiny body struggles and twists on her foot, which is full of filth and blood. They are forced to inhale the hallucinogenic fumes that emanate from her.\n\nAs for the surviving small people, they were long controlled by the catgirl's scent. They have all become \"foot bugs\" that cannot live without the scent of her feet, lying in her toe crevices, making those unconscious, lustful cries. Even if their companions next to them are inadvertently crushed by the catgirl's toes, they’d just wipe their faces and continue to lick the blood-stained foot debris.\n\n\"You know, meow~ If I wanted to, you would become just like them~\".\n\n[Root.Leader.GetName] was picked up by the catgirl's toes. Their lower body was also being constantly violated by the catgirl's huge purple tail.\n\n\"But meow~ I think, since your civilization was able to come here, does that mean~ that you little bugs can bring me countless little people~\".\n\nThe catgirl's two legs gently closed together, [Root.Leader.GetName] was thus firmly sandwiched between two huge walls of flesh, rolling and grinding unconsciously in the world of foot dirt.\n\n\"So, meow~ maybe we can make a deal~\"\n\nClearly, she was not talking to the [Root.Leader.GetName] who had completely fainted during her foot play.

  # Apro Recruitment Follow-up Events
  gts_aplog.10.name: "Strange Troops"
  gts_aplog.10.a: "Apro has fulfilled her initial promise, although the number of people consumed by her can hardly be estimated.\n\nWhen we arrived at her \"palace\", a group of people she had captured as maids were surrounding her body, constantly stimulating the giant catgirl's sensitive spots. Apro, without holding back, was violently thrusting her lower body with a dildo made of several maids bound together.\n\n\"These are your troops…\"\n\nAfter climaxing, Apro collapsed on the floor and pointed at a room. Inside, we found a batch of trained troops.\n\nAlthough they do indeed do nothing but obey orders as she said, looking at their empty eyes and the indescribable smell emanating from their bodies, we have reason to suspect some unpleasant things…"
  gts_aplog.10.a.answer: "Never mind, the more we know about these things, the more dangerous it is for us."
  gts_aplog.10.b: "We overestimated Apro’s evil side.\n\nIt was only when we saw her stuffing those poor things into her lower body that we realized what price we had to pay for this army. During each thrust, a foul-smelling fluid flushed out a large number of small people's remains. Arms, bones, and viscous blood, all mixed together during the giant Apro's masturbation, were crushed almost beyond recognition. \n\nWhen our envoys came to ask for their troops, this lewd and terrifying giant cat even stretched out her hand covered in lust fluid towards them. If they hadn't dodged in time, our envoys would likely have disappeared into the bottomless abyss.\n\n\"They're trained, they're over there meow~\"\n\nApro picked up a sock from the side. With just a shake, many small people fell out. They didn't seem to feel pain after hitting the ground, but stood up numbly, staring at the sock with empty eyes.\n\n\"With this, you can command them, meow~\"\n\nApro threw the sock towards our envoys and continued to indulge in her endless lust."
  gts_aplog.10.b.answer: "At least... we got what we wanted..."
  gts_aplog.10.c: "What did she do to us!??\n\nWe shouldn't have agreed to her offer. Now, our people are struggling like trash under her rule.  A city carrying countless people is held in her hands and disappears down her throat, turning into nutrients that are digested in her churning stomach acid. Some unlucky cities even have to endure a cat-and-mouse torment before being eaten by her.\n\nWhen Apro stood barefoot in the city she had chosen to be the feeding ground, countless cannons and explosions bloomed on her toes. But the giant catgirl simply tapped her toes, and all the so-called cannons and missiles were erased by the prints of her fleshy toe pads. The survivors could only struggle for their lives in the crevices of the giant cat's toes, forced to breathe the suffocating air. When Apro was done playing, those crying humans could only watch helplessly as she dug up the dilapidated city and tossed it into her pink honey hole or dark maw.\n\nSeeing our envoys, Apro listlessly dragged her foot on the ground. After turning the city that was still struggling into remains that stuck to her sole, she put her hand deep into her small hole. After some \"squish squish\" sounds, she threw a ruins that was mixed with love fluids at us.\n\n\"Well~ these small things that can resist the squeeze from my honey hole the best. I hope there'll be more tenacious ones next time, meow~\""

  gts_aplog.11.desc: "We overestimated this catgirl's bragging, especially when she was struggling in the lower bodies of our inexperienced recruits.\n\nHer dark purple hair and cat ears, which were wet with lust fluids, were plastered on her head. No matter how hard she struggled, it was futile. She could only watch helplessly as she was being pushed deeper and deeper into the small hole.\n\n\"Meow... Master! Master please... don't... Apro doesn't want to go there...\"\n\nUnfortunately, our girls, who were already in the heat of it, couldn't hear Apro's plea, a toy like giantess. With a \"squish\" sound, combined with Apro's cry, this small-sized giantess who was used as a vibrator was completely stuffed into the honey holes of our new recruits.\n\nHopefully she enjoys it."

The sandals still didn't lose their power after they crushed the wall, as they slid for hundreds of meters through the residential area before finally stopping.

  gts_aplog.40.desc: "Today is a special day as it is §YApro's§! tenth birthday since she came to our empire.\n\nContrary to her usual arrogance, this catgirl was unusually not asking to use the lives of our people to celebrate her birthday. Instead, she applied to the military prison for a day as an \"executioner\".\n\nCountless criminals and prisoners were herded into cages, then transported by helicopter to  §YApro's§! \"palace\". At §YApro's§! strong request, we had to broadcast live, allowing the entire empire to witness her unique way of celebrating her birthday.\n\nClearly, these people who are used as consumable tools had yet to realize their place. Their mouths were full of regulations such as \"human rights\" and \"prisoner of war conventions.\" §YApro§!, who is obviously not under the jurisdiction of these kinds of laws, simply closed her hand, and the iron cage holding thousands of people exploded in a tooth-aching screeching sound, turning the lives inside into a crumpled pile of garbage. A mixture of red and white spurted out from her cute finger crevices.  §YApro§! deliberately held her bloody hand over the remaining cage and let the blood of the rebels dripped onto the remaining small people, and said with a hint of contempt:\n\n§S \"If you can’t make me happy on my birthday, you’ll all be sentenced to death, meow~\"!§!\n\nFaced with some confused yet still yelling people, §YApro§! only licked her fingers and brought her fingers, now wet with sweet fluids, into the air.\n\nThe poor little guys didn't even have the ability to free themselves from the sticky sweet fluid. After being stared at by the giant catgirl for a long time, they were once again brought to another hot place. They didn’t even have time to understand what part of the giant catgirl’s body they were in before a piercing howl shattered their eardrums. The last scene they saw was the immense yellow gas spraying from the giant asshole in front of them.\n\nBut it seemed that §YApro§! did not intend to let them off the hook. These guys who had a layer of skin peeled off by the catgirl's farts seemed to have their last breath, and so §YApro§! bluntly pressed the guys against her soft chrysanthemum hole and rubbed them.\n\nTo them, the soft folds of the girl were no different from huge hills; the stuff that covered them was like boulders that were cutting through the bodies and souls of these criminals. Under the non-stop rubbing, many unfortunate bugs were forced to swallow §YApro’s§! uncleaned excrement. Even though their bodies were already broken and their faces were almost crushed, they still became decent toilet paper for §YApro§! under her tyrannical will, helping her complete a part of her playtime.\n\nAfter feeling clean, §YApro§! also unapologetically ended their humble lives with a much bigger fart.\n\nAfter these appetizers, the playful §YApro§! didn’t even bother acting. After selecting a few prisoners and captives, she dumped the remaining small people into the city prepared for her. The small people, who were looking at each other, thought that they had become the lucky ones, and began to mock their companions who were chosen by §YApro§!.  Their laughter, however, suddenly stopped when §YApro§! pulled down her pants and aimed her lustful asshole at the entire city.\n\n“You guys dared to laugh at your companions. It seems your sins are not small, meow~ Be grateful to me, if you can live through this, you might be able to establish a civilization built on my excrement, meow~”\n\nThe energetic voice of the girl above them sentenced the entire city to death. The panicked crowd pushed and shoved, fighting over the vehicles but could not escape the shadow that the asshole casted. The asshole that covered the entire sky twitched, and a thick, dark piece of excrement charged towards the city center with a rumble, and after closer inspection, traces of undigested bones and building debris could still be seen inside.\n\nBut before the excrement crushed the city, the warm and foul odor emitted from them charged into the city with a tyrannical force, indiscriminately gathering each and every unlucky person. These guys, who couldn't even touch §YApro’s§! excrement, were boiled alive by the heat of her excrement, their last conscious act being to barely open their eyes and to watch the catgirl's huge excrement fall from the sky and crush everything in its path.\n\n§S \"Hmm~ thinking that those little guys can’t even stop my excrement, ehehehe…\"§!\n\nThe small people who were specially captured by §YApro§! were finally scattered on the birthday cake we had prepared for her. The burning candles, the cheerful birthday songs, the cream on the cake... those were small people who were desperately trying to climb their way up, but as for their fate, our \"temporary executioner\" had already decided. We hope they can bring a happy birthday to §YApro§! in her belly."

The despairing shadow cast by her nearly ten-thousand meters of height was enough to envelop the entire city-Apro could even hear screams among the crowd, the sounds of despair and sorrow were so pleasant to hear.\n\nHowever, just watching was too boring, even more boring than a child crouching on the side of the road watching ants, Apro thought after waving her tail. Then, after she used her tail to hit the edge of the city and provoked human screams,she came up with a wicked idea-she dropped her black tail into the city, most felines are very sensitive to their tails, and the catgirl was naturally the same.\n\n“That’s right meow, the goddess's orders asked to leave a signature of the executor… so I’ll just sign with my tail then.”\n\nUnlike the other goddesses under the deity's command, although Apro also liked to write her name in the human cities and planets, she preferred to use her tail, because her tail was especially sensitive and stomping it on the small city brought her a different kind of pleasure.\n\n\"Signed! What is the number now meow… Two million, three hundred and twenty thousand… that should be about right?\"\n\nHearing the playful words that indicated that she had enough, humans finally looked up. They were looking up expectantly, hoping the sky-obscuring devil would get bored and leave. Unfortunately their hopes were not fulfilled as the bad cat would not so easily let go of a toy that she had selected.\n\n\"The rest is… Not needed anymore~\"\n\nWith a resounding and heated step, the giant foot stomped down mercilessly. Although her words were frivolous and playful, the force that crushed the human city was as if she was taking revenge, both the signature she drew using her tail and the towering buildings the humans had built over the decades were all treated like expendable materials to relieve the heat from her soles.\n\nOf course, even if 10k meter giants were careful when crushing a place, they would still leave traces of small life that could survive in the cracks of their giant footprints, not to mention that this big cat was just casually crushing down - but even so, the urban complex of this early FTL era could be regarded as completed destroyed."

  gts_aplog.1022.desc: "\"So... why would there be a task that required me to stay at this size, meow? Does the goddess have nothing to do?\"\n\nDespite complaining, Apro was still happily looking at the planet, an early FTL civilization that had almost achieved prosperity and unity. If she split them into cities to play with she would have more than enough to keep herself occupied for a long time-and the task that the Goddess had issued was just to execute the sentient life there.\n\n\"Good afternoon, meow~\"\n\nApro greeted the tank divisions on the ground while smiling. Of course, she was doing it using her foot that was already covered in dirt.\n\nLong before Apro stepped on the first city, the humans on the planet had already organized a resistance force, but unfortunately, their air force, ground force, or even navy couldn't inflict enough damage on the giantess who was at 10,000 meters. Most weapons would just bring pleasure to her. \n\n\"Is it fun?\"\n\n\"Haha, it's super fun~..... Meow?\"\n\nApro was originally happily watching the morale of the troops on the ground collapsing, she was thinking of how to make them raise their morale again and start attacking her again but now she wouldn't dare think of that again, because the being that was now appearing beside her was a monster that was ten times more cruel than her! \"Wait, why are you here, meow!\"\n\nThe great cat definitely didn't expect that there would be other goddesses under the goddess's command on this insignificant little planet, in fact, even the entire inter-civilization alliance inside the \"Toy Box\"\n\nUniverse couldn't protect themselves when facing a goddess, their survival depended on the goddesses or their goddess's will.\n\n\"What, are you not welcoming me?\"\n\nYanxi raised her eyebrow, then showed a mischievous smile and walked towards the great cat-both of them were, at this moment, at a majestic 10k meter state. Which meant that what was just like simply taking a walk for her was actually a terrifying massacre for the humans who were already being tormented by Apro.\n\nBut actually... if you were to look at it objectively, Yanxi was wearing high-heels, the space between her heel and the sole of her foot were big enough for some survivors to take shelter.\n\n\"I don't welcome you! Hah!!!\"\n\nThe great cat chose to hiss, however such an act might be considered to be a deterrent to the beings that she had trampled on, or even a powerful weapon-but for her to do this towards a goddess who was her equal, was simply looked down upon her self.\n\nThe great cat was grabbed by her ear then collapsed limply, although cats' ears were extremely sensitive, that wasn't the true reason why apro collapsed so easily after being grabbed-The true reason is that she had a large city that she could use as a carpet here."
  gts_aplog.1023.name: "The Goddess's Task"
  gts_aplog.1023.desc: "“Meow meow meow! Let go-nya!”\n\nYanxi released her hand, but before Apro could rub her now-burning ear, Yanxi bit it at once-she did release it, but she never said she would just let her go.\n\nThe result of this was, the two of them tumbled down into the urban complex. Naturally, it didn't cause much damage to them. In fact, it was more like they were doing it on purpose, since every part of a goddess’s body is a perfect weapon to execute small people. To a goddess, they probably look like two maggots writhing together, but to the small people being crushed under them... they look like two giant dragons mating in a human city.\n\n\"Wait, what’s this, meow…\" \n\nSeemingly feeling a sharp object poking her again, Apro's face suddenly changed from an expression of pleasure to… a more intense expression of pleasure. She casually grabbed a nearby city that was still structurally sound, and made a motion of feeding someone.\n\nHigh-rise buildings, reaching near 100 meters in height were just as fragile as a crispy wafer in the goddess's hands. As for their taste, to them, the taste of concrete and steel was the same as the planet itself; it was all just a question of whether they were a bit crunchy or thick.\n\n\"Is it good– hey, you’re being serious, meow!\"\n\nApro, who had just \"fed\" her snack in her hand to Yanxi, felt her body lessen under her. But even before she could climb up, her gaze was caught by Yanxi, who was taking off her skirt\n\nTaking off her skirt… Apro had already imagined what was about to happen next– she was about to get fucked, she was about to get fucked flying, she was about to… get satisfied to death.\n\nThe great cat didn't hesitate at all, she just braced her body and found the best spot, then lay down like a female beast in heat.\n\n\"Are you being serious?\"\n\nYanxi repeated Apro's words, but unlike Apro's excited and horny tone, the sound she made after wiping her mouth was like a company employee who was forced to work overtime on the weekend by an unscrupulous boss.\n\n\"It's just the goddess’s task.\"\n\nAlthough the two girls have been causing a ruckus on this planet for a long time, the destruction they had caused wasn't too terrifying. Except for the city where Apro had drawn her name and the forces that were trying to resists, as well as the city were they were currently causing a ruckus, many other people on this planet had not been slaughtered - in fact, on this pre-FTL planet, there were many countries that were still unaware that their planet had become a toy in the hands of the goddesses.\n\n“Are going to take it off yourself, or should I help… how did you finish already?”\n\nApro was already lying obediently on the ground, wearing nothing besides a bra that was barely concealing her full breasts. While Yanxi was hesitating as to whether she should take down her comrade or go to the goddess's belly to clean up the stubborn scraps, Apro had already consciously taken off her clothes and thrown them down carelessly. Whether it covered or crushed a few small towns in the process.... she didn't want to think about it anymore.\n\n\"Come here, meow!~ Come here, meow!~\"\n\nSeemingly thinking that she wasn’t attractive enough, scared that her comrade would use the monster below her body to go mess with other small people, Apro deliberately patted her full buttocks to seduce her-the seduction was very effective, but for her comrade, that probably didn't count as seduction. For Yanxi, it was more like a provocation."
  gts_aplog.1024.name: "The Goddess's Task"
  gts_aplog.1024.desc: "Yanxi's soft, white hands pressed on Apro’s chocolate-colored buttocks. The warm body with its good texture always made her think indecently, a beautiful and alluring body like this, paired with Apro’s somewhat masochistic and bullying-type personality, meant that she was often bullied by the other goddesses… but you couldn't really call it bullying.\n\nYanxi was thinking as she wasn't behaving her hands, while Apro was enjoying every touch and began moaning, her wild moans easily shattered the glasses all over the city.\n\n\"Calling out so loudly?\"\n\nYanxi adjusted her center of gravity to her upper body and repeatedly rubbed her full breasts against the great cat's back, although the great cat's build was already considered to be curvy and sexy, after all, she still had those beast ears and tail, which made her less imposing, this means she was almost unable to breathe from the weight of the breasts pressing against her.\n\n\"Meow… ooh……\"\n\nThe loud and wanton calls turned to soft pants, and naturally this action couldn't escape the observation of the civilization on this planet-in their eyes, the time to fight back had finally arrived.\n\n\"Does it feel good?\" \n\nYanxi looked at the catgirl under her, who was \"painfully\" clenching her hand together. It was hard to tell whether Apro was enjoying the sensation or she really is in pain. After all, the other hand of the cat was stubbornly trying to grab at Yanxi's sex organ… \"Does the little cat still have the strength to resist?\"\n\nApro's hand eventually gave up, not because she couldn't reach it, but because her own breasts were getting pinched-were pinched hard.\n\nThen, among the people who had barely reorganized their resistance forces, most of them could only release a muffled huff, and were immediately knocked unconscious, and a few fortunate ones were able to see a milky white flood gushing over them... perhaps the purpose of building the city for the decades was just to witness the enjoyment of the goddesses.\n\n\"I'm out of... I'm out of strength, meow.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nAs her hand released Apro's full breasts, Yanxi once again leaned near the great cat's ear- but this time, she was not going to bite her ear, but rather to announce one thing.\n\n\"This is just a warm up~\"\n\nHowever, after saying those words, Yanxi stood up neatly, then left the slightly confused great cat who was still moaning from the pleasure there.\n\n\"Sister Yanxi? What are you doing, meow?\"\n\nIn the eyes of the great cat, Yanxi's actions were like that of a middle-aged man in his forties, asking her to lie obediently in bed while waiting for her recharge, but in reality, goddesses like them could go on for years without stopping.\n\n\"Could it be that Sister Yanxi has been broken by the goddess, meow...\"\n\nYanxi crouched in front of another city. Amidst the terrified gazes of the small people and the bored gazes of the great cat, she poked around under her skirt-she wasn’t just enjoying herself while Apro grabbed her, but rather because she needed to take something out from under her skirt.\n\n\"This angle should be okay, barely?\"\n\nThe smartphone, which was much larger than any buildings, was crushed down upon the city. The people who were still watching the show couldn't even run away in time, and were smashed into a bloody smudge on the phone's shell. But that was not the end. A high-rise building that was built by mortals who couldn’t even break past the gravitational field was no match for the weight of the goddess's phone. The high-rise buildings that had cost countless manpower and resources fell over like dominoes… It was only after Yanxi got annoyed at the way she had placed them and picked at the city's foundations that her phone could rest steadily inside the city.\n\n\"Meow meow? What angle?\"\n\n\"It’s the goddess's task.\"\n\nUnlike her previous perfunctory voice, Yanxi's voice now had a hint of playfulness, after all, as a goddess who was always being used by goddess for her personal pleasure, this was the first time she found a goddess's task somewhat interesting.\n\n\"How did you play it last time, meow?\"\n\n\"Last time?\"\n\nWhile seeing Yanxi squatting on the side of the city, messing with her phone, the cat languidly rolled over and answered leisurely,\n\n\"I picked the most popular prettyboy on that planet. Made him 10,000 times bigger and made him pin me down on their capital and fuck… I have to say he was quite strong and had stamina. But in the end, I turned him back to normal, hmm… did he end up drowning in his own cum, or was it my juices?”\n\nYanxi’s fingers that were messing with the phone paused, in the end she couldn’t help but swipe right, while the screams of humans and the sound of high-rise buildings falling over was ringing beside her, what was also ringing was Yanxi voice with slight hints of anger.\n\n\"You little slut cat, I'll fuck you to death.\""
  gts_aplog.1025.name: "The Goddess's Task"
  gts_aplog.1025.desc: "\"What is that?\"\n\nA boy opened the live-streaming app on his phone in disbelief, which had no title or author but was firmly fixed at the top of the trending list on the live-streaming app.\n\nThe boy nervously tapped on the stream.\n\nTwo girls with faces that were more beautiful than humans could ever imagine, entered his view. They were two giant girls... two giants beyond his imagination, were laying over a city that was unrecognizable. They were… having sex?  The phone was faithfully transmitting the wanton moans of the two goddesses fornicating along with the horrifying images– The high-rise buildings that were built by the humans were powerless and fragile against the flood of secretions from the two goddesses. The remaining survivors were defenseless and completely annihilated by the lustful fluids.\n\nAnd in order to let this weak civilization feel the power of the goddesses, Yanxi also thoughtfully added a few features to the live-stream. The most prominent of which was the death count– in this unleashing of lust, the number of deaths had reached a shocking 1.43 million+.\n\nBut even these absurd and horrifying acts of slaughter made blood rush to the boy, as he was seeing a behemoth that was more terrifying than the Tower of Babel vibrating like a pile driver, his below also inexplicably swelled up-he knew that this shouldn’t be the case, but he simply couldn’t control himself...This was just a tiny part of the whole planet. Over half the males on this nearly ten billion population planet started masturbating during the absurd live-stream, and the number of females was even higher.\n\n\"Is it good, my dear little slut cat~\"\n\nThe naked Apro had curled up into a ball-it was very obvious that cat was enjoying herself, judging from her feet wiggling and curling throughout the act of being fucked. A shelter, that was buried deep underground had become a piece of trash stuck to her toe...... and that was only just an unconscious act that she had made while being fucked.\n\n\"Uuuaaah…\"\n\n\"Alright, I’ll go see how the vote is going.\"\n\nYanxi picked up Apro's short skirt very carelessly and tied it around her waist, such an act could barely cover the terrifying beast in her lower body-although even gigantic sized giantesses wouldn't care what small people thought, not to mention goddesses like them, whose bodies had liberated themselves to a celestial level of existence. If she truly wanted to, she could put every single human inside that planet into her high heels.\n\nYanxi crouched again in front of the other city, but unlike the deliberate stance she took before, this time she indiscriminately trampled over the people of the city, although her placing the phone previously had also caused a lot of casualties. \n\n\"Hmm, let me see… 2.12 million, there should be none left, ok then…\"\n\nYanxi picked up the phone that was propped up by a high-rise building. Originally, she was planning to leave right there since the goddess's task was only to let her take revenge on the slut cat-but seeing that the weak civilisation on this planet still dared to resist, it provoked her desire to destroy them.\n\n\"Then, let's start a vote~\"\n\nYanxi randomly swiped on the phone, in a few taps she had created the poll that she wanted to start-\"The next City to Appreciate.\""
  gts_aplog.1026.name: "The Goddess's Task"
  gts_aplog.1026.desc: "The humans on this planet have understood what Yanxi and Apro wanted to do, but the problem was that they had no ability to resist those two monsters, even an entire armored corps was nothing to them other than something to step on. Using a nuclear weapon of the highest yield had become their last option-but all of this completely crumbled before the poll that Yanxi had created; \"What if those two devils just go and mess up other cities?\"\n\nSuch thoughts entered the minds of ordinary people, and some weak-willed leaders thought the same thing.\n\n\"Little slut cat, go look what the top vote is.\"\n\nOriginally, Yanxi was going to just crush them directly, but when she saw the great cat, who was not dressed completely but just wagging her tail while lying in the ruins, she inexplicably wanted to fuck her… it must be a curse cast by the goddess, it must be.\n\n\"How troublesome, there’s no need to look at the votes of these little bugs, does this mean sister Yanxi, you have no stamina-“\n\nBefore Apro could finish her provocations, she was hit by a high heel that came at her face-it was still okay to just hit her, after all, their size was still the same up to this point. The heel, which could crush hundreds of humans, could do no more than just make her hurt a little.\n\nBut things were not as simple as Apro imagined, after all, provoking the small people, that even she couldn't clean the filth from their feet, was different from provoking a goddess who was above her in the hierarchy.\n\nThe high heel, which was emitting a hot and foul scent, slammed Apro into the cities, the two goddesses who were initially almost the same size had instantly become as different as the clouds and the mud.\n\n\"Oh dear, little slut cat, I forgot to tell you just now, the result of the vote was that besides us having to go to country A, you'll have to shrink down ten times, meow~\"\n\nWhat Yanxi didn't say was that she has also grown ten times larger. She only fully covered the city where she had posed her phone just by sitting down. For the small people, the act of a goddess covering something with her body was a sure death sentence.\n\n\"Uuuuuh!\"\n\nApro let out an unclear wail, but Yanxi chose to ignore her. She just sat stably and elegantly on top of the small people's city– now you could say it’s the remains of a city, and then put on her black silk stockings. She didn't have any peculiar hobbies like putting small people or small cities in her stockings or shoes. It was only today that she actually finally understood why her colleagues liked such play styles.\n\nThe hot and humid environment inside stockings and high heel shoes is enough to execute most of the small people. The lucky ones who survive will undoubtedly become nourishment for the goddesses’ feet. Even for the luckiest of the lot, they will eventually become a smear of red on the goddesses’ shoe or soles when the goddesses walk.\n\nThe above thoughts were from when Yanxi put Apro inside her shoe-Apro's m-attribute had completely exploded and enabled her goddess colleague to truly treat her like a small bug that she could put on. Of course, Apro wasn't completely submissive before this, as she was still able to dig up chunks of the city to place inside Yanxi's high heels with ease while maintaining her 1000-meter stature.\n\n\"Country A, huh… it actually suits your name quite well, Little slut cat~\"\n\nAlthough she has a 100,000 meters tall body, and that even mountains were just obstacles to overcome with each stride, in order to truly let the civilisation of this little planet experience the power that they possessed, she chose to walk very, very slowly. But then again, the vote that she had initiated was for them to \"Appreciate\" after all.\n\nA body that was 100,000 meters in height was an extremely frightening figure for those civilizations that have broken free of the shackles of gravity, not to mention this weak civilization. On the road to the country A, which received the most votes, more than 10 cities had been cut in half or were completely covered by Yanxi's giant feet in high heels. At this point, you couldn't help but appreciate the difference between high heels and bare feet. Yanxi’s rampage while wearing high heels caused something like 723,120,000 causalities. If she had done it with Apro's bare feet, then the casualties would have probably been around 1.2 billion."
  gts_aplog.1027.name: "The Goddess's Task"
  gts_aplog.1027.desc: "\"We’ve arrived, meow~\"\n\nIt’s unknown whether Yanxi’s charming voice was directed at Apro or the humans that were \"appreciating\" the broadcast but, because of that call, over half of the humans still alive and watching that broadcast on this planet had increased the intensity of their grip because of that one coquettish exclamation.\n\nThat also included the people in country A.\n\nMany of them had launched their most intense yet futile resistance - before reaching the target city, countless fire power had rained down, the most effective among which was the high-yield nuclear weapons of the sea’s forces, which successfully scratched Yanxi’s ankle.\n\nThat little point of light did successfully catch the goddess’s attention, but in just a few minutes, Yanxi walked from one end of this planet to the other. The collateral damage she caused along the way was even more terrifying than the most brutal war on this planet. But to some extent, if you take a look at their actions, these actions were rather gentle-after all, the civilization on this planet believed in the law of the jungle, and both Yanxi and Apro could crush the planet with one finger or put it in their shoes to slowly \"enjoy\", but they didn’t, that was certainly a gentle act.\n\n\"Was it around here...\"\n\nYanxi crouched down and started to take off her shoes – To her it could be considered a sort of ritual. Of course, to Yanxi, who had entered a state of \"rigor mortis\", the troops of Country A, who were still struggling to keep their morale up, started their last suicidal attacks.\n\nHowever, even the land-based tactical nuclear weapons could barely touch Yanxi's silk stocking, while the rest of the land forces could only watch in despair at the black mountain in front of them ... It was a majestic existence that they will never even surpass in their lives.\n\n\"Hmm… It’s a little hot, meow~\"\n\nFinally Yanxi slipped off her heels and socks, letting her feet make familiar contact with the ground. She let the city of humans be a way for her feet, which were already getting moist, to relax-Apro’s gasps nearby also still managed to retain their vigor.\n\n\"You bastard, quickly release me... \"\n\nUnfortunately, before Apro could finish her words, she saw Yanxi's foot came back-from her angle, she could see that the pure white sole was now covered in bits of black city debris and scraps from armored vehicles, Apro could even see the bits of trash falling like hailstones as Yanxi teased them by shaking her foot.\n\n\"Sorry, meow...\"\n\nYanxi chuckled shook her head, and then dropped her foot into another city -Even someone with an iron will wouldn’t have the heart to crush it again after hearing that big cat moaning for more than ten minutes, right?\n\n\"You can come out for now, I’ll see what we should play next.\"\n\nWhile Yanxi was fiddling with her phone and starting the next poll, Apro, feeling vengeful, crushed the city that Yanxi trapped her in inside her high heel into mud and then stepped into a new urban complex. Although she could not compare to Yanxi, who was now at 10k meters tall, even a body at 1000 meters was still absolutely fatal to this civilization-not to mention that the big cat was now a ball of rage, this time she was going to crush the city of those small people to vent her anger. There was nothing she cared about more than being able to bully the weak with her nature.\n\n\"Why are there so many votes for the sex option...\"\n\nYanxi glanced at the surrounding cities with some disdain. If they were to do it at her current size along with her beloved little slut-cat, then the entire city would be submerged in two of their juices... Yanxi suddenly realized something was wrong, the little slut-cat was at 1000 meters right now, she wasn't even bigger than the giant beast beneath her…. In Yanxi's original plan, the little slut-cat who was supposed to be penetrated was blissfully unaware at this point, she was still walking leisurely among this \"huge\" urban complex, greeting the resistance forces of Country A, \"Hydrogen Peroxide Uracil Arsenic\"\n\n\"You trash! Vermin! Microbes! All go and die, meow!!!\"\n\nApro casually swung her cat tail, pulling down buildings that humans called high rises, turning the fruits of their labor and painstaking effort into garbage that caused secondary disasters. However, even in the face of such desperate scenes, there were still a number of people who actually dared to put up a fight. The lucky ones were either buried or smashed into meat paste by the collateral damage of the cat tail, and the unlucky, they were either grabbed by Apro and thrown into her mouth, like sprinkling sugar- most of them only had their limbs remaining due to Apro’s violent actions– or they were just completely flattened by the dirty foot pad of Apro, becoming a part of her dirty footprint.\n\n\"Hahaha! All of you shall become my slaves!\"\n\nHowever, such cruel behavior was quickly stopped, as it was not that Apro suddenly became kind and let these bugs go, or even that they had launched an attack to hurt that goddess who was only 1000 meters tall. What happened was the cat who was wildly causing destruction was propelled up into the air.\n\nThe great cat who was just flexing her power was thrown up and then caught in her hands.\n\n\"Yan!xi! Hah!!!\""

  gts_aplog.1028.desc: "Although Apro really wanted to stuff the smiling goddess in front of her into her small hole, after all, she was just knocked up into the air with that thing.\n\n\"Wait for a bit, okay~\"\n\nYanxi licked the now dirty cat while smiling, and then raised her phone and held it up in front of Apro.\n\n\"They said, they also want to see you use futa magic, meow~\" A slender finger reached from Apro’s head, then stroked all the way to her lower body… \"What do you say, little kitten?\"\n\nAs Yanxi placed Apro on the ground again, she smiled and crouched down.\n\n\"But I’m so small right now, meow?\"\n\nApro had also used Futa magic before, but this size... even using these high-rises as a fleshlight was still too big for her.\n\n\"Hmm, let me see the vote…\"\n\nYanxi leisurely waited for the small people on this planet to make their decision while using her fingers to split apart the city-of course she could’ve disregard the rules, but seeing the small people thinking they can use her as a tool to kill their enemy made her playful side come out, these small people didn't actually think that Country A was the end, did they? \"Hmm, 60,000 times then, what do you think Apro?\"\n\nThe most votes went to 1 times the size. The next highest was one-tenth the size - but these votes were just something Yanxi would laugh off. Did they think that a goddess would obey the words of these little bugs? \"It's okay meow!\"\n\nApro answered with a perfectly agreeable tone on the surface, but on her tan face, she could no longer hide her intentions-it goes both for her colleague, and at those yet-to-be-bullied small people.\n\nThe next instant, the little cat became a great cat. The coarse tail of Apro was even large enough to circle the entire city. But what would the cat, with their vast and strong body do, or what would be done to her? \"Wait a second... Meow!!\"\n\nA giant pink beast reminiscent of a dragon ripped into Apro’s rear hole, as the intense friction and vibration occured the two lovers’ fluids began flowing out all at once-but a 100,000m tall body was not the same as a 10,000m tall body. The sheer act of white liquid falling from the sky was enough to crush the strongest buildings. And just by the act of their feet twitching, whole underground shelters built decades ago get dug up… They were just releasing their desires in a city and didn't even have the subjective intent to destroy that city consciously, and yet their fluids alone submerged the capital of Country A. And the small unconscious actions they made crushed and trampled hundreds of thousands to death.\n\nHowever, that was only just the start of their lovemaking. As the two girls stuck closer to each other, the bra that was now completely soaked in sweat, the heat and sweat that was dripping from their bodies, the sound of fleshy skin rubbing together while their breasts and backs were pushing into each other… all of this touched the hearts of the \"audience.\"\n\nFor the audience, it was a terrifying massacre of over 17 million deaths, but it was also the most luxurious outpouring of desire in the world.\n\nAfter all, if we were to take the citizens of Country N that are on the opposite side of country A for comparison, what business of theirs would it be if those two 100,000 meter giantesses were doing it in Country A's capital? “Plop!”\n\nWhen their lovemaking reached its climax, the futa magic that Apro had been subjected to finally activated. Her monster, which was nowhere near the size of Yanxi, stood proudly tall, and then thick milky white fluids shot out like a planetary destruction cannon-high-rise buildings, troops, crowds, or whatever else it was, all were blown apart in the face of the goddesses' power, and because of the colossal scale of the two goddesses, Apro’s juices even sprayed into the capital of Country E, which was next to Country A.\n\nAfter all, the distance between countries was probably even smaller than their foot length.\n\n\"Yanxi… That was amazing, I won’t say that you need to recharge again…\"\n\nVisible hearts appeared in the eyes of the big cat. However, Yanxi still didn't stop her actions-she randomly threw aside the phone with which she was filming so that it crashed to the border of Country E and A, and then she began to rub and squeeze on Apro’s full, healthy breasts… as the Big Cat was pushed under Yanxi’s weight, the two’s juices had already overflowed to several meters in height, but even then, around 100,000 lucky people of Country A had managed to survive. But those lucky ones were also the unfortunate ones; as they were submerged into the sea of ​​juices, they got completely flooded by the fluids that leaked from Apro’s breasts during her milk explosion…"

  gts_aplog.1030.desc: "The survivors in the shelter seemed very surprised that we were able to land on the surface of this planet. And we were surprised to find out that the technology contained within the small shelter seemed to be even more powerful than that of our most advanced research ships.\n\nWe tried to communicate with them, but they only gave us a unique recording-compared to the technology level of their shelter, the recording was simply too crude. But in order to obtain their technology in a \"peaceful\" way, watching the recording was necessary.\n\nThe contents of the recording were not unfamiliar to us.\n\nNext to a fairly large coastal city, a sandal that was far too large for it landed on the sea... or rather, it was slammed down on the near-shore. The waves that it created submerged the humans' so-called \"sea view houses\".\n\nThe recording’s view shook severely, and when the picture became clear again, another sandal soaked in black footprints was lying sideways in the middle of the city. Along with the cries of the humans, the frightening fires erupting and the sky-obscuring shadows, this sandal that had fallen right in the center of the city actually had some sort of desolate religious significance.\n\n\"Hello there, Small toys~\" That was a voice that we were extremely familiar with.\n\nA gigantic wheat colored foot stepped down from above, seemingly \"gently\" placing the sandal upright-such an ordinary action, crushed the busiest office building district of this city… such an act was probably just the beginning.\n\n\"Oh dear, it seems I have accidentally crushed your city, you won’t be angry at me, right?\"\n\nThe playful yet familiar voice echoed over the city. But those words that were enough to make one’s blood boil and their fists clench didn't stop them, both the normal people and their defense forces, who were fighting with all their might, couldn't cause even the slightest reaction to that 10,000-meter tall girl- in fact, only the fighter squadron were able to have their bombs land on the catgirl's foot, and what the rest of the troops were doing was merely decorating the catgirl’s sandals.\n\n\"Oh dear, it hurts, I think I'm about to be defeated by you–\"\n\nThe sky-obscuring girl gave off a seemingly weak voice, she lifted her foot with a feigned interest and then walked inland-and this actually did give the city which was trying to save itself a bit of spark of hope for survival\n\n\"Hmm, to be precise, I should say that I was hit by you all.\"\n\nAs the catgirl’s tail gently swished around, she also aimed her stance. Her plump, tall buttocks were facing the “huge” coastal city.\n\n\"Hoo hoo, apl has fallen by you all –\"\n\nAs the view shook once again, all we could see was just a giant butt print, with molten lava overflowing at its deepest point, and at the very edges you can see the flood of the ocean… a city with tens of millions of people became a hellish scene just like that, and that was only due to that giantess that called herself apl casually slamming her rear onto the ground\n\nThe scenes after that were all similar, showing the catgirl that called herself apl conducting playful acts of slaughter. However, the last scene was enough to make one worry - on a planet covered with giant footprints, butt prints, juices, and…excrement, was a pair of emerald green eyes.\n\n\"She left us alive on purpose, saying that she wanted us to build a new civilization for her to play with.\"\n\n\"And so, we built this shelter…even after millennia passed, we still couldn’t resist her, but she also didn’t seem to ever come to look at our planet again.\"\n\n\"Now that you’ve found us, we can only give you one warning… be careful with her!\""

  # Apro Events (Old)
  gts_aplog.11.name: "Training Small Person Soldiers"
  gts_aplog.11.desc: "As a commander who is well-versed in the art of small person and giantess joint operations, Apro has recruited a large group of small person mercenaries across the galaxy. In the coming days, Apro will train these small person soldiers into qualified warriors, teaching them how to cooperate with giantesses who are a hundred, or even a thousand times larger than themselves."
  gts_aplog.11.a: "Begin training!"
  gts_aplog.12.name: "Catgirl Physical Training!"
  gts_aplog.12.desc: "Apro is leisurely lying on the training base. And if you look closer, you will find a group of small person soldiers who are panting while slowly running on Apro's thighs and back.\n\n\"Being this is slow is no good. If the giantesses were to suddenly get moving, you will not have a chance of running to a safe area!\"\n\nAlthough Apro can't see the small soldier warriors running on her body while lying down, she can feel some bugs crawling sluggishly on her body.\n\n\"Too slow! Do another two laps!\" \n\nIn reality, Apro was enjoying the wonderful feeling of the small people running on her body. Her lower body couldn't help but get wet..."
  gts_aplog.12.a: "Poor small people."
  gts_aplog.13.name: "Catgirl's Bombardment Training"
  gts_aplog.13.desc: "\"Today, the coordinates you are to bombard are... here and here!\"\n\nThe small soldiers, who were unaware of the truth, started to bombard the coordinates given to them by Apro with their cannons. All kinds of artillery fire came pouring down.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nIntense explosions came from the targeted area. But what the small people don't know was that these coordinates are Apro's sensitive spots...\n\n\"Ahhh! This feeling! Hmm~\"\n\nThe intense explosions stimulated Apro's private parts. After intense artillery bombardment, all that was left was a limp Apro, and a pool of unidentified liquid."
  gts_aplog.13.a: "She's beyond saving."
  gts_aplog.14.name: "Elite Small Person Warriors"
  gts_aplog.14.desc: "Apro has trained a large group of small person warriors who can withstand various extreme (giantess-related) environments. They are serving at the borders and the battlefields of the empire. They are fighting side by side with the giantess warriors, making our forces invincible. Apro has also accumulated even more training experience, so now we can train elite small person warriors!"
  gts_aplog.14.a: "Excellent!"
  gts_aplog.15.name: "Catgirl's Punishment"
  gts_aplog.15.desc: "Training with the giantesses is not an easy task for small soldiers. There will always be some mischievous giantesses who will make use of their size advantage to bully these small people. Some small people tried to sneak out of the base by clinging onto the clothes of the giantesses, as they couldn't endure the \"harsh\" conditions.\n\nBut they miscalculated. The giantess that they were clinging onto was extremely sensitive, and she quickly sensed the existence of these small soldiers and turned them over to Apro."
  gts_aplog.15.a: "What will happen?"
  gts_aplog.16.name: "Catgirl's Punishment"
  gts_aplog.16.desc: "\"Hmph, you guys are quite bold, trying to sneak away.\"\n\nAppro scolded the small people and then took off her shoes.\n\n\"As for small people like you, I have a lot of ways to train you!\" \n\nApro grabbed them and threw them into her steaming shoes.\n\n\"You are to thoroughly reflect on what you’ve done here. I'll release you after a month!\" In general, small people will only be locked inside Apro's shoe for a week if they do something wrong. But, as this is a much more serious matter, Apro has decided to use her shoes to reform these small people.\nIn the dark, sealed off shoes, these small people can only eat the flakes shed from the catgirl's feet, drinking the sweat from her feet to survive."
  gts_aplog.16.a: "Poor Small people."
  gts_aplog.17.name: "Catgirl's Punishment"
  gts_aplog.17.desc: "One month later, when Apro was getting ready to release them, she discovered that these small people were already inseparable from the environment inside her shoes. They had been completely tamed by Apro's shoes and had become pitiful bugs that could only eat metabolic waste..."

  gts_aplog.17.a: "Too tragic."
  # Apro Archaeological Events (Old)
  gts_aplog.1.name: "Fierce Beasts"

  gts_aplog.1.desc: "It has been some time since we colonized this planet. Our colonists often report the discovery of giant beasts whose physiological structures do not match that of this planet. These creatures are clearly not native to this planet. Our research team has ordered the establishment of a research site here to further investigate this phenomenon."
  site_gtsra_aplog: "Habitable Star Sector"
  site_gtsra_aplog_intro: "Scientific scans show that there are some huge, fierce beasts on this habitable planet, which don't seem to be native to this planet. We need to investigate further."
  gts_aplog.900.name: "Fierce Beasts"
  gts_aplog.900.desc: "Our survey team arrived on the surface of this planet, and was met with the sight of the aftermath of a fierce battle. Based on the traces, these beasts are likely to be as tall as 100 meters and have extremely strong power. Aside from the traces of these beasts, there seem to be footprints left by some humanoid animals. The sizes of these footprints vary greatly, with the smallest being only a few decimeters and the largest being over ten meters long! Could it be that there are also intelligent lifeforms on this planet?"
  gts_aplog.900.A: "Continue the investigation"
  gts_aplog.901.name: "Corpses Everywhere"
  gts_aplog.901.desc: "Following the footprints of the beasts, our survey team came to a dangerous area. Those previously powerful beasts are now lying quietly on the sidelines, the blood that they spilled had turned into a stream, and a group of scavengers are fighting over the corpses. After analyzing the corpses, our survey team discovered that these beasts closely resemble the Chimera and Hydra of ancient records and that they died from a fatal blow by a large, sharp weapon. The deepest section of those wounds could even reach 26 meters in length, making  it almost impossible for ordinary beings to inflict such serious damage, so who killed them?"
  gts_aplog.901.A: "We must find out"
  gts_aplog.902.name: "Feast"
  gts_aplog.902.desc: "Our survey team found a huge dragging mark. Following the mark, we reached a hidden area that was never scanned from space. To our surprise, this place has a small settlement. Although extremely primitive, it can be seen that the owners of this settlement possess enough intelligence, and their physique is of average size when compared to other space-faring civilizations. After investigating the settlement, we discovered that it had been used recently but, we could not see a person in sight. In the center of this settlement, we found a large fire pit, and the pile of giant bones scattered around seemed to belong to the giant beast that had previously been dragged here. What was amazing was that the mountain-like beast was eaten completely in just a few days. This was simply too bizarre for a creature of average size. We must find out where these people went, maybe they have some truly interesting traits."
  gts_aplog.902.A: "Find them as soon as possible!"
  gts_aplog.903.name: "Dilemma"
  gts_aplog.903.desc: "After looking everywhere for some time, our survey team were also attacked by these beasts. They blocked the route back to their ship, forcing the survey team to venture deeper in. On the way, we found more clues about the intelligent life on this planet. Besides items left by the original humanoid-sized beings, there was also a giant pair of panties that seemed to belong to a larger being. What was even more surprising was that the level of civilization that we observed said that it should be impossible for them to manufacture this unique material. The only possibility for such massive unexpected item on this primitive planet was a titanic giantess who simply used it while going sightseeing. But the  size of these panties was too diminutive for these galaxy-sized giantesses. After a bit of an argument, the survey team still weren’t able to reach a conclusion. To whom these panties belong? Only by continuing to investigate can we find out."
  gts_aplog.903.A: "Let's go a bit deeper."
  gts_aplog.904.name: "Ambush"
  gts_aplog.904.desc: "We arrived at the deepest point, but were still unable to locate those people. Just as we were planning to find a way out, an even larger beast jumped out of the shadows; it was over 150 meters tall, and was likely the ruler of this area. This beast moved its huge body, and stepped toward us, its giant claws were raised high to the sky. Just as those sharp claws were about to fall-\n\n\"Haa!\"\n\nFrom behind the monster, a giant, humanoid being, roughly 100 meters tall, jumped out. Judging by her tone and the cat ears on her head, she was likely a giant catgirl. She swung a giant axe at the monster's head, but the monster quickly turned to block the deadly blow. After that, the giant monster and the giant catgirl began fighting on this land, in that instant, blood and gore flew everywhere, and the shockwaves from the fight shook the entire area.\n\n\"Taste this! Ripping Rocks Flying Ring!\"\n\nAfter saying that, the catgirl's axe cut into the beast's heart, killing the monster instantly. At the same time, the humans who were waiting on the sidelines also rushed out, celebrating around the dead monster.\n\n\"Behemoths are still just that.\"\n\nWhile these small beings were celebrating, she wiped the blood on her face and hands and walked towards us..."

  gts_aplog.904.A: "What?"
  gts_aplog.905.desc: "\"You…are you guys from the Empire?\"\n\nShe stared at us intently."
  gts_aplog.905.A: "What empire?"
  aplog_site.7.desc: "\"What? What other empire could it be other than the Allagan Empire?\"\n\nSome doubt appeared in her eyes."
  aplog_site.7.A: "Never heard of this Allagan Empire..."
  aplog_site.8.desc: "\"Okay, I guess too much time has passed…\" \nShe looked into the distance and was silent a moment.\n\"It seems like you guys are not agents of the Empire. I will explain things to you. My name is Apro, and I am a warrior. When I was little, the Allagan Empire invaded my homeland. Although they are smaller than us, they have more advanced technology..\""
  aplog_site.8.A: "..."
  aplog_site.9.desc: "The catgirl let out a long sigh toward the sky. \n\"Later, my homeland fell, and my loved ones left me one by one. I had no choice but to join the Imperial Army to survive and serve their expansionist goals. I and my smaller teammates fought in every corner of the solar system. Because of our achievements, I became a centurion, leading a small person unit.\" \n\"During a battle, our transport ship was ambushed by the enemy fleet. We crashed on this planet, and the synthetic monsters of the Allagan Empire also crashed with us-the same giant beasts you saw just now. We tried to contact the Empire, but never received a response. After that, we waited for rescue on this planet.\""
  aplog_site.9.A: "What happened after that?"
  aplog_site.10.desc: "\"Just like what you saw, after countless long years, we still did not receive rescue, so we had to survive on this planet filled with monsters, while praying that we will return to the stars someday.\" The catgirl warrior wiped a tear from the corner of her eye while she talked."
  aplog_site.10.A: "It's okay, you can serve us instead!"
  # Apro Leader Recruitment (Old)
  NAME_gts_aplog: "Apro"
  DESC_gts_aplog: "A battle-hardened giant catgirl warrior who likes to fight alongside the small ones."
  gts_aplog_catch_phrase: "It's time to train some more small person soldiers!"
  gts_aplog.999.name: "Apro"
  gts_aplog.999.desc: "I’ve finally waited until this day. I really don't know how I managed to endure all those years. Now that the empire has fallen, I have finally regained my freedom. Me and my small person warriors need to gather under a new banner, and if you need it, my ax will serve you."
  gts_aplog.999.a: "Your small person warriors?"
  gts_aplog.999.a.response: "Those people are my subordinates, and they would carry out my orders without hesitation. They will be responsible for scouting enemy positions, drawing their fire, and attacking places where I can not reach…\nOf course, they can only do this after rigorous training, like climbing my body while I'm walking, or training inside my shoes every day. I'm more than willing to train new recruits if they want to join."
  gts_aplog.999.b: "Your combat capabilities?"
  gts_aplog.999.b.response: "I’m not only a commander, but also a moving supply base that can provide strong firepower for the frontlines… And most importantly, I can use my size to tear apart the enemy's defenses, level their trenches, and act as the spearhead of the attack. That’s how it was when I served in the Empire."
  gts_aplog.999.c: "About the empire..."
  gts_aplog.999.c.response: "The Allagan Empire, which I previously served, almost ruled the entire star system. But this was only on the surface. In reality, each sector was hostile to each other. The people that were conquered also rebelled in various places, and the Empire used giantess units and powerful synthetic beasts to suppress the rebellions in the star system. Their most powerful technology was the size-transformation technique, which allowed them to modify the size of a person almost arbitrarily, but the price was that it used a massive amount of energy, and it was difficult for even an entire solar system to support it."
  gts_aplog.999.hire_custom_tooltip: "§YApro§! has joined our empire as a §Hleader§!."
  gts_trait_leader_aplog_a: "Joint Operations"
