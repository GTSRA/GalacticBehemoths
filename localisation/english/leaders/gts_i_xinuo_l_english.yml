  gts_xinuo.1.name: "Seeds of Hatred"
  gts_xinuo.1.desc.gts: "We discovered a miniature black box during exploration. Our tiny science officers decoded its archaic video interface, syncing the feed to your terminal.\n\nThe footage shows a suited man amidst apocalyptic warfare. §H'Future viewers,'§! he wearily addresses, §H'The Synthetic Queen has breached our capital. When first contact occurred, we naively sought diplomacy... how wrong we were.'§!\n\nThe view shifts to blue wing membranes. §H'Xino, release me.'§! §B'Father, combat here could-'§! interrupts a feminine voice. §H'That's an order!'§! The wings reluctantly withdraw, revealing a war-torn sky where artillery impacts the dragon's wings. Scale comparisons suggest the少女 stands several dozen times taller than normal humans.\n\n§H'We engineered dragons hundreds of times our size using Xino's genetics,'§! the man explains. §H'But time ran out. Whoever receives this - use our research. Avenge us!'§! As he collapses in relief, the视频 cuts to an enormous hand plucking his shelter from the ground."
  gts_xinuo.1.desc.tiny: "We found a durable black box requiring specialized tools to open. Fortunately, its antique video interface connected to our displays.\n\nThe recording shows catastrophic urban warfare. §H'Our anti-synthetic dragon weapons needed more development time,'§! explains the exhausted researcher. Scale analysis indicates the blue-haired少女 visible later stands thousands of times taller than baseline humans. The video concludes with her colossal fingers crushing the shelter."
  gts_xinuo.1.a: "Show me the rest!"

  gts_xinuo.1.b: "We want no part in this!"
  gts_xinuo.2.name: "Annihilation's Approach"
  gts_xinuo.2.desc: "Satellite footage reveals the少女's full form - now over 100,000 times normal size. Her stiletto heels leave molten craters as she methodically crushes cities beneath them. The Synthetic Queen's forces scatter before being trampled into bloody paste. §B'Mmm~'§! she moans, cheeks flushing with pleasure as entire civilizations vanish underfoot. After reducing the planet to a wasteland of footprints, she casually annihilates the orbital fleet before vanishing into the void.\n\nThe box clicks open, revealing a damaged access card to the genetic research facility."
  gts_xinuo.2.a: "Search for surviving technology!"

  gts_xinuo.2.b: "This isn't worth our time!"
  gts_xinuo.101.name: "The Forgotten Depths"
  gts_xinuo.101.desc.gts: "Our scientists playfully demolish surface ruins - buildings shatter like toys against their skin as they wrestle across the dead cities. The首席's fingers reduce skyscrapers to grime in her fingerprints. Meanwhile, engineers struggle to penetrate bedrock compacted by the少女's heels, requiring industrial foam and her direct stomping to fracture the strata."
  gts_xinuo.101.desc.tiny: "We excavate through the apocalyptic footprints, carefully tunneling between the petrified heel marks to reach the buried facility. The少女's weight has fused sediment into near-indestructible layers, forcing us to improvise access shafts through weaker geological points."

  gts_xinuo.101.a: "Continue the excavation."
  gts_xinuo.102.name: "Delving Deeper"
  gts_xinuo.102.desc.gts: "Our giant researchers reluctantly send tiny assistants through the narrow access shaft. The miniature team navigates by flashlight through derelict corridors until finding a hidden door that accepts the ancient keycard."
  gts_xinuo.102.desc.tiny: "After overcoming multiple equipment failures, we finally breach the facility's spiral staircase. The exploration team moves cautiously through the darkness until discovering the secured genetic archive."
  gts_xinuo.102.a: "Discover what lies within."
  gts_xinuo.103.name: "The Unknown Path"
  gts_xinuo.103.desc.gts: "The door slowly rotates, unveiling the research facility's secrets. Darkness envelops the interior, with only emergency indicators providing faint illumination. Nearly all systems have ceased operation. Our miniature team's lights barely reveal equipment reaching 200 meters high - several cultivation chambers nearly scrape the ceiling, seemingly designed for beings our size. To tiny observers, these would be unimaginable genetic weapons. The engineering team departs to restore power.\n\nWhen lighting activates, the sudden brilliance causes discomfort even through video feeds. At least now we can observe properly - rows of massive cultivation chambers contain skeletal remains, except Chamber 007 where a winged少女 slumbers. Records indicate she's grown beyond her original specifications. Though identical to the少女 in footage, she stands only 100 times normal human height - matching our size. Whether she retains growth potential remains unknown. Further investigation reveals she's a genetically degraded reverse-engineered product with encoded loyalty to whoever awakens her."
  gts_xinuo.103.desc.tiny: "The rotating door reveals a 200m-high facility where ceiling-scraping cultivation chambers suggest terrifying bioweapons research. After restoring power, we find Chamber 007 contains a winged少女 matching the footage's subject, though only 100 times normal size. Records indicate she's a loyalty-imprinted genetic duplicate with degraded growth capacity from rushed reverse-engineering."

  gts_xinuo.103.a: "Proceed cautiously - assess usability."
  gts_xinuo.104.name: "Ancient Legacy"
  gts_xinuo.104.desc.gts: "Identity verification identifies §Y'Roz Celitz'§! as project lead. Records show 15 specialized prototypes were created - only adaptable #007 survived the catastrophe. Though most genetic data was purged, remaining codes might restore degraded sequences. Full facility access granted, but scientists will modify only select genes to ensure stability."
  gts_xinuo.104.desc.tiny: "The access card belongs to lead researcher §Y'Roz Celitz'§!. Of 15 specialized prototypes, only adaptable #007 survived. Partial genetic codes remain despite data purges, allowing cautious optimization of her sequences without altering core parameters."

  gts_xinuo.104.a: "Preserve baseline data integrity."
  gts_xinuo.105.name: "Genetic Protocol"
  gts_xinuo.105.desc.gts: "As editing commences, #007 shows revival signs - scientists administer sedatives during painful crimson fluid injections. When vital signs stabilize, the chamber transports to central position via underground rails, where researchers await nervously."
  gts_xinuo.105.desc.tiny: "Genetic recalibration triggers revival processes - crimson nutrient fluids flow as scientists carefully monitor vitals. After stabilization, the central chamber rumbles into position along subterranean tracks."

  gts_xinuo.105.a: "Initiate contact sequence."
  gts_xinuo.106.name: "Bioweapon"
  gts_xinuo.106.desc: "The opening chamber reveals the nude少女 - though a weapon, her flawless form causes discomfort. Fluttering eyelids reveal gleaming golden draconic eyes radiating primal authority. Finally she speaks: §B'Xino, reporting for duty per manufacturing directives.'§!"

According to orbital weather observation, it is like the eye of a storm, expelling all abnormal weather. Typhoons, thunderstorms, or polar cold currents are tightly blocked. But we can never observe the situation in the center. The answer to all this awaits investigation by the research team.\n\nWith such questions, the archaeological team moved towards that strange place. Her massive size allowed [Root.leader.GetName] to reach the destination in half a standard hour without any vehicle. But to collect more information, [Root.leader.GetName] prospected in multiple cities on the way. Whole cities were dug up and crumpled between her white fingertips, just to let her explore the underground secrets. However, except for abandoned air raid shelters, there was nothing special underground worth investigating. After four or five disappointments, [Root.leader.GetName] completely ignored the cities under her feet. Her black boots stepped directly on the empty cities. Fragile buildings disintegrated and shattered under her feet. A slight tingling sensation came up through the platform. [Root.leader.GetName] felt her face flush, a strange feeling sprouted in her heart. Her hot body drove her to slowly pull down the zipper of her boots, pulling her black-silk-covered feet out. Watching [Root.leader.GetName] like this, the team members began to laugh, then let loose, leaving brown footprints in the surrounding cities.\n\n\"Bang! Bang!

Unexpectedly, through comparison, this is a high heel print. It is hard to imagine how huge the owner of this shoe is. After measurement and comparison by the science officer, the result far exceeded all creatures we recorded—she is fully 40,000 km tall, even larger than the diameter of this planet! The science officer cannot speculate what kind of humanoid creature can survive with such a body size. Food consumption and energy consumption for such a body size are immensurable for ordinary people.

 # 为了避免对下面的实验设施造成破坏，考古团队选择了人工发掘的方式，但1400米的土层发掘时间太久了，最终在讨论之下，考古团队决定通过地层破碎机先挖掘1100米，最后300米通过单人挖掘系统进行探索，这样也能帮助我们精准控制发掘的区域。\n\n地层破碎机被包裹在空投舱中，从科研船坠落，炽热的火光笼罩着其外壳，一秒……两秒，随后重重砸在地下，其中的泡沫缓解了落地冲击。组装完成的地层破碎机发出了隆隆的响声，方圆五十米内的地面开始剧烈震动，蛛网般的裂隙出现在了大地之上，本应坚实的土层在不停的震动中变得松软，随后被机械臂上巨大的圆盘碾成齑粉，短短一分钟，大地就出现了一个大坑。机器不断轰鸣，地表持续下沉，一层一层的阶梯也在破碎中形成，换装的新型传感器和模具能够让机器同时完成地表的破碎与阶梯生成，这倒是省了不少事。几分钟后一条幽深的通道在众人面前显露，机器的轰鸣越来越小。考古团队带好装备，沿着阶梯向下。\n\n声波探测装置发出的脉冲扫描着周围的环境，这上面确实只有一层土壤，并没有任何防御，但究竟是怎么屏蔽了我们科研船的探测设备，这更耐人寻味，在考古团队向下走了一段距离后，地层的晃动消失，估计是破碎机完成了自己的任务停了下来。考古团队加快了脚步，十五分钟后在下面看到了破碎机显示器的绿色光芒，在设置返回任务后，她沿着来时的通道缓慢上行，而科研团队则开始人工勘探。\n\n又是一个小时的时间过去，研究员们终于到达了目标深度，坚实的金属天花板出现在了我们的脚下，这或许就是研究院的防御工事，依靠着声波探测器，考古团队找到了多条道路，似乎每一个都通向这个星球的一个主要城市，但当务之急是寻找一个进出设施的地方，在向一边继续挖掘后，一个宽敞的地下洞穴出现在考古团队面前，研究院所在的地方只是这个地下洞穴小小的一部分，在采用激光测距后，这个洞穴的直径达到了420公里，在这样的空间下，无论是高速公路还是生产设施都被布置在了一个坚实的平台上，建筑被统一刷成白色，似乎是为了在地下的黑暗环境提高辨识度，街道两旁矗立的路灯如同忠诚的卫士一般，即使整个地下设施被废弃，它依然挺立。
 gts_xinuo.101.desc:0 "To avoid damage to the experimental facilities below, the archaeological team chose manual excavation. But excavating 1400 meters of soil layer takes too long. Finally, after discussion, the team decided to excavate 1100 meters with a stratum crusher, and explore the last 300 meters with a single-person excavation system, which can also help us precisely control the excavation area.\n\nThe stratum crusher was wrapped in a drop pod and fell from the science ship. Blazing fire enveloped its shell. One second... two seconds, then it smashed heavily underground. The foam inside cushioned the landing impact. The assembled stratum crusher made a rumbling sound. The ground within a fifty-meter radius began to shake violently. Web-like cracks appeared on the earth. The supposedly solid soil layer became soft in the constant vibration, then crushed into powder by the huge disc on the robotic arm. In just a minute, a big pit appeared on the ground. The machine roared continuously, the surface continued to sink, and layers of stairs were formed during the crushing. New sensors and molds allowed the machine to complete surface crushing and stair generation simultaneously, saving a lot of trouble. A few minutes later, a deep passage was revealed in front of everyone, and the machine's roar became smaller and smaller. The archaeological team put on equipment and went down along the stairs.\n\nThe pulse from the sonic probe scanned the surrounding environment. There was indeed only a layer of soil above, without any defense. But how it shield our science ship's detection equipment is intriguing. After the team walked down for a distance, the stratum shaking disappeared, presumably the crusher finished its task and stopped. The archaeological team accelerated their pace. Fifteen minutes later, they saw the green light of the crusher monitor below. After setting the return task, it slowly went up along the passage it came from, while the research team began manual exploration.\n\nAnother hour passed. The researchers finally reached the target depth. A solid metal ceiling appeared under our feet. This might be the institute's fortification. Relying on the sonic probe, the archaeological team found multiple paths, each seemingly leading to a major city of this planet. But the priority is to find a place to enter and exit the facility. After digging further to one side, a spacious underground cave appeared in front of the archaeological team. The place where the institute is located is only a small part of this underground cave. Using laser ranging, the diameter of this cave reached 420 kilometers. In such a space, whether highways or production facilities, they were arranged on a solid platform. Buildings were uniformly painted white, seemingly to improve visibility in the dark underground environment. Street lamps stood like loyal guards on both sides of the street, still standing upright even though the entire underground facility was abandoned."
 # 部署软梯后，考古团队沿着墙壁下去，手电的光线刺入黑暗的心脏，驱散了地下的阴霾。沿着白色的走廊向前，一道高耸的钢铁大门出现在了我们的眼前，似乎是因为失去电力的缘故，厚重的大门虚掩着，考古团队正好可以借此进入研究院。\n\n室内杂乱不堪，手电光照射的地方全是散落的纸片，队员们收集着纸片，拼凑着数据，一个针对星神兽的基因计划浮出了水面，早已消失的帝国竟然通过提取星神兽的基因来制造生物兵器，但现有的数据大多都是废弃的，考古团队必须继续深入，寻找更多有效信息，希望一切顺利。\n\n考古团队摸索着前进，虽然这里并没有交火的痕迹，但许多东西早已被人为破坏，甚至还有焚烧的痕迹，不知是否是紧急销毁实验数据，失落的帝国到底被什么入侵，以至于他们如此恐惧？在建筑中不断搜索着，考古团队并没有什么发现，但启动的声波探测装置却在一面光滑的墙后找到了一条通往更深地区的隧道。这种桥段真像古代小说里的剧情，或许我们应该进去看看？
 gts_xinuo.102.desc:0 "After deploying the rope ladder, the archaeological team went down along the wall. Flashlight beams pierced the heart of darkness, dispelling the underground haze. Moving forward along the white corridor, a towering steel gate appeared in front of us. It seemed that due to power loss, the heavy gate was left ajar, just right for the archaeological team to enter the institute.\n\nThe room was messy. Places illuminated by flashlights were full of scattered papers. The team members collected papers and pieced together data. A gene plan targeting Star Gods surfaced. The long-gone empire actually created biological weapons by extracting Star God genes. But existing data was mostly scrapped. The archaeological team must go deeper to find more effective information. Ideally everything goes smoothly.\n\nThe archaeological team groped forward. Although there were no traces of crossfire here, many things had long been artificially destroyed, and there were even traces of burning. Unknown if it was emergency destruction of experimental data. What invaded the lost empire to make them so fearful? Searching constantly in the building, the archaeological team found nothing. But the activated sonic probe found a tunnel leading to a deeper area behind a smooth wall. This plot is really like an ancient novel. Maybe we should go in and have a look?"
 # 压抑……黑暗的空间总是会让人感觉不舒服，即使有小队一起行动，也难以抵挡长时间的寂静，焦虑蔓延开来，到了地下室后，这样压抑的感觉更为浓烈，一股直击心灵的震慑不断在周围产生，巨大的压力让团队的进度异常缓慢，但越靠近地下室，这样的感觉就越轻，似乎地下室有着什么东西在抵抗着心灵冲击，团队迅速转移至地下室门口，不知道这么长久的时间过去了，什么东西还能保持着这样的光芒，不过我们无法打开这扇门，门禁系统依然在工作着，这样持久的能源或许也值得我们的科研团队去研究，但当务之急依然是寻找可以打开门禁的物品，这些东西应该就散落在大厅之中。\n\n团队返回大厅，从杂乱的物品中寻找着那一丝希望，在大厅上上下下都搜索过后，一个吊牌被找到，人像与其上的字早已模糊，不过卡片应该还能使用，在将卡片放上去后，门成功打开，实验室内被一层厚厚的玻璃所围绕，一条走廊围绕着这个房间，明亮的蓝光完全驱散了地下的阴霾与沉闷，但依然没人能看清那里藏着什么，黑色的隔离门将里面与外面分割为了两个世界，再次刷卡，广播中轻柔的女声传来：\n\n§Y“艾丝菲雅主管，欢迎回来。”§!\n\n卡片的主人在这一刻终于被揭露，但是我们没有在收集的资料中发现任何关于这个人的信息。\n\n沉重的铁门缓缓打开，一个一人多高的培养舱出现在了众人眼前，透明的玻璃罐中一个赤身裸体的少女正在沉睡，及腰的蓝发随其中的液体散，头上的两只角上镶嵌着三对淡黄色的宝石，更令人吃惊的是，少女背后有一对一人高的翅膀，翅膀向周围发射着明亮的蓝光将她包裹在其中，但这样的光亮并没有让人感到刺眼，反而用一种神奇的力量抚慰着所有人的身体，随后流入人们的精神之中，疲惫与不安一扫而空，取而代之的是一种悠闲的感觉，仿佛在此刻看到了蔚蓝的天空与碧绿的草原，但研究员们没有沉溺在这样的体验当中，他们依然在寻找着可能了解到罐中少女的身世，将收集到的信息总和后，一个复杂而庞大的计划被勾勒出来。
 gts_xinuo.103.desc:0 "Depressive... Dark spaces always make people uncomfortable. Even with a squad moving together, it's hard to resist long silence. Anxiety spread. Upon reaching the basement, this depressive feeling became stronger. A shock hitting the soul directly was constantly generated around. Huge pressure made the team's progress unusually slow. But the closer to the basement, the lighter this feeling became. It seemed something in the basement was resisting the psychic shock. The team quickly moved to the basement door. Unknown what could maintain such light after so long. However, we cannot open this door. The access control system is still working. Such lasting energy might be worth our research team's study. But the priority is still finding items to open the access control. These things should be scattered in the hall.\n\nThe team returned to the hall, searching for that glimmer of hope among messy items. After searching up and down the hall, a tag was found. The portrait and words on it were blurred long ago, but the card should still work. After placing the card, the door successfully opened. The laboratory was surrounded by a layer of thick glass. A corridor surrounded this room. Bright blue light completely dispelled the underground haze and dullness, but still no one could see clearly what was hidden there. Black isolation doors divided inside and outside into two worlds. swiping the card again, a gentle female voice came from the broadcast:\n\n§Y\"Director Esfiers, welcome back.\"§!\n\nThe owner of the card was finally revealed at this moment, but we found no information about this person in the collected data.\n\nThe heavy iron door slowly opened. A cultivation pod taller than a person appeared in front of everyone. In the transparent glass jar, a stark naked maiden was sleeping. Waist-length blue hair scattered with the liquid inside. Three pairs of light yellow gems were embedded in the two horns on her head. More surprisingly, there was a pair of person-high wings behind the maiden. The wings emitted bright blue light around, wrapping her in it. But this light was not dazzling, instead comforting everyone's body with a magical power, then flowing into people's spirits. Fatigue and anxiety were swept away, replaced by a leisurely feeling, as if seeing the blue sky and green grassland at this moment. But the researchers didn't indulge in this experience. They were still looking for the origin of the maiden in the jar. After summing up collected information, a complex and huge plan was outlined."
 # 一个繁荣的帝国在千万年前崛起，在它那悠久的历史当中，它的人民不断开拓与征服，一个又一个的星球成为了其疆域内的殖民地，而这些殖民地又撑起了帝国庞大的开支，人们安居乐业，帝国稳固了自己的疆域后，联合了星海中其他的国家共同构建了一个名为星海共同体的联合组织。在对此的记载中，曾经甚至有着众多的星神兽存在于那个时期，当时的人们以科技的力量掌控着自然与神明，犽戎，紫宸，荧萘，九色，以及舱内少女的基因原型——§B希诺§!，这些星神兽不仅是帝国的守护神，也是相互制衡的方式。下面的一张照片让考古团队看清了星神兽的体型，只见与罐中少女一模一样的龙娘环绕着那“小小的”恒星，那炽热的恒星对比龙娘的手就像个网球，随时都能被一把捏住，永远熄灭。\n\n研究员们继续分析着手中的记录，其中有一份报告中提到了天灾，这或许是他们进行基因工程的原因？他们从那巨大的龙娘的身体上提取了基因，通过生物技术孕育一个个胚胎，这样的工程是艰难的，许多胚胎在生长过程中就因为基因的缺陷死亡，最终成为了铺垫最终兵器的基石，而在我们眼前的，是少数完成了最终育成的胚胎之一，也是唯一一个存活下来的生存适应性增强胚胎，虽然根据实验数据表明她的最大体型只有基因原体的一半，但是其拥有堪比基因原体的生存适应性，能够在宇宙空间长时间作战，如果真能量产，其作战能力难以想象，但是看起来胚胎并没有在他们的国家还存在时完成，天灾席卷了他们的国家，满怀仇恨与复仇怒火的人民将这件武器深深封存，但并没有完全隔绝外人，这倒是让我们捡了个便宜，根据实验数据，这样的少女已经是在舱内孕育完成了，现在考古团队要做的是跟着操作指示，完成这最后的步骤，他们为我们留下的宝藏，或许是对抗那所谓天灾的最终武器。
 gts_xinuo.104.desc:0 "A prosperous empire rose tens of millions of years ago. In its long history, its people continuously pioneered and conquered. Planet after planet became colonies within its territory, and these colonies supported the empire's huge expenses. People lived and worked in peace. After stabilizing its territory, the empire united other nations in the star sea to build a united organization called the Galactic Community. In records of this, there were once numerous Star Gods existing in that period. People at that time controlled nature and gods with the power of technology. Yarong, Zichen, Yingnai, Jiu Se, and the gene prototype of the maiden in the pod—§B Xinuo §!. These Star Gods were not only the empire's patron gods but also checks and balances. A photo below allowed the archaeological team to see the Star God's size. A dragon girl identical to the maiden in the jar surrounded that \"small\" star. That hot star was like a tennis ball compared to the dragon girl's hand, ready to be pinched out at any time.\n\nResearchers continued analyzing records in hand. One report mentioned the Crisis. Perhaps this was the reason for their genetic engineering? They extracted genes from that huge dragon girl's body and bred embryos through biotechnology. Such a project was arduous. Many embryos died during growth due to genetic defects, finally becoming cornerstones paving the way for the ultimate weapon. And what is before us is one of the few embryos that completed final cultivation, and the only surviving survival-adaptability-enhanced embryo. Although experimental data shows her maximum size is only half of the gene primarch, she possesses survival adaptability comparable to the gene primarch and can fight in space for a long time. If she can really be mass-produced, her combat capability is unimaginable. But it seems the embryo was not completed while their country still existed. The Crisis swept their country. People full of hatred and revenge sealed this weapon deeply, but did not completely isolate outsiders. This allowed us to pick up a bargain. According to experimental data, such a maiden is already fully nurtured in the pod. Now the archaeological team needs to follow operating instructions to complete this final step. The treasure they left for us might be the ultimate weapon against that so-called Crisis."
 # 在走进房间后，科学官根据操作指南拉下了注入神经复苏剂的拉杆，连接着培养舱的管道中出现了一道绿色的溶剂，随后散开在整个培养舱之中，透明的舱壁上被粘稠的绿色薄膜所覆盖，浑浊的液体挡住了研究员们的视线，但是其中的人影似乎微微动了一下，\n\n§B“哼……嗯……”§!\n\n几声娇弱的喘息声从舱室内传来，正当我们科学官尽力向内观察时，一只白皙的手突然重重拍在内壁的玻璃上，随后一张完美无瑕的脸庞从浑浊的水中浮现，耳后三片蓝色的鳍片飘荡水中，好像童话中的美人鱼一般，琥珀色的眼睛死死盯着正在看着科学官，眼神中充满了疑虑与愤怒，捏成拳头的双手按压着内壁，咔擦咔擦的玻璃破碎声响起，蛛网般的裂痕以少女双手为中心散开。\n\n科学官紧急拉下复位按钮，周围的粘稠的绿色薄膜瞬间向后收缩，看似柔软的薄膜紧紧贴在少女的肌肤上，刚刚能靠力量压裂玻璃的少女此刻却像蝉蛹一样被牢牢包裹住，即使少女不断挣扎也无法逃离这样的束缚，科学官借此机会按下了紧急按钮，一阵白色雾气被注入其中，具有镇定效果的溶剂让少女的挣扎逐渐减弱，眼神也平静下来，面无表情地看着舱外的众人，在确定了少女没有进一步威胁后，众人继续研究着这些遗落的资料，通用文书写的资料倒是不难解读，但是有些名词缺太过生僻，抑或是古老，难以被理解，只能依靠研究员们一步步去尝试，不过这中间倒是没出什么差错，在顺利完成最终的阶段后，控制面板上的§Y“success”§!让众人松了一口气，或许等待这进度完成后，我们就能知道在重重防御之下的少女有什么样特别的地方了。
 gts_xinuo.105.desc:0 "After walking into the room, the science officer pulled down the lever to inject neural resuscitation agent according to the operation guide. A green solvent appeared in the pipe connected to the cultivation pod, then spread throughout the pod. The transparent pod wall was covered by a sticky green film. Turbid liquid blocked the researchers' sight, but the figure inside seemed to move slightly.\n\n§B\"Hmph... hmm...\"§!\n\nA few delicate gasps came from the chamber. Just as our science officer tried to look inside, a fair hand suddenly slapped heavily on the inner glass wall. Then a flawless face emerged from the turbid water. Three blue fins behind her ears floated in the water, like a mermaid in a fairy tale. Amber eyes stared dead at the science officer, eyes full of doubt and anger. Fists pressed against the inner wall. The sound of cracking glass rang out. Web-like cracks spread from the maiden's hands.\n\nThe science officer urgently pulled down the reset button. The surrounding sticky green film instantly retracted backward. The seemingly soft film tightly stuck to the maiden's skin. The maiden, who just cracked the glass with strength, was now wrapped tightly like a cicada pupa. Even if she struggled constantly, she couldn't escape such binding. The science officer took this opportunity to press the emergency button. A burst of white mist was injected. The solvent with sedative effect gradually weakened the maiden's struggle, and her eyes calmed down, looking expressionlessly at everyone outside the pod. After confirming the maiden had no further threat, everyone continued to study these left-behind materials. Documents written in common language were not hard to decipher, but some terms were too uncommon or ancient, difficult to understand, only relying on researchers to try step by step. However, there were no mistakes in between. After successfully finishing the final stage, the §Y\"success\"§! on the control panel relieved everyone. Perhaps waiting for this progress to complete, we can know what is special about the maiden under heavy defense."

 gts_xinuo.15.desc:0 "Dawn was breaking. Remnant defenders who had fought for days to repel enemy attacks were just about to close their eyes when increasing vibration and noise woke them up like an alarm clock. Fearing enemy arrival, defenders rushed back to battle posts.\n\nWalking out of houses with weapons, surprised not to be blinded by sunlight, puzzled guards turned their wrists. Their old partner on the wrist told them it was already 7 AM, but the block under their feet seemed abandoned by sunlight, stealing a sliver of light from adjacent blocks. Detecting anomalies, a bad guess appeared in everyone's heart. With inner unease, while activating global satellites to probe the environment, soldiers followed the panicked crowd and speeding vehicles to deduce the disaster's direction, slowly scanning houses and streets, until seeing that large abruptly blue wall in the suburb. Looking up, they realized it was a giant high heel, and looking up sharply, they met the eyes of that huge existence.\n\nImages from sky monitors allowed defenders to better see the whole picture. A blue-haired dragon girl squatted outside the city, her cast shadow covering half the city. A skirt bright as moonlight replaced the azure canvas, outlining snowy white legs as splendid as sunlight in the starry sky formed by the skirt. Just right meatiness and good proportions, possessing both child-like cuteness and mature woman's sexiness. If one had the chance to touch, feel the slightly lower body temperature and tender feeling, one would be obsessed with the softness slightly collapsing with kneading.\n\nThe slender dragon tail leaking from behind looked crystal clear like a bright gem, adding a bit of non-human mystery. Holding her naturally beautiful face with slender and long fingers, she coldly examined every tired defender below with golden dragon pupils. Defenders identified this likely as the enemy leader Xinuo.\n\nDefenders were already scared weak in the legs by the huge object in front, also an evil god exceeding human power. Stumbling a few times, they knelt on the ground with a thud. Weak hands tried several times to retrieve dropped guns. Survivors at the time recalled, in that half hour, even if officers kept building them up psychologically, inner fear made their bodies tremble uncontrollably, finally only able to tremble holding weapons for so-called resistance.\n\nThis silence was broken by Xinuo first. \"If you surrender now, I won't touch everyone. We can still coexist peacefully.\" Xinuo smiled at the ground army, her tail wagging slightly behind, showing a harmless look to intimidate.\n\n§B\"Resistance is futile, you know\"§!\n\nHearing Xinuo's words, a veteran from the front line went weak in the legs and fell to the ground. Nearby recruits hurried forward to help. Before the recruit could comfort him, the emotionally overwhelmed veteran grabbed the recruit's wrist tightly, almost crying as he recounted his experience.\n\nThe maiden's slender finger fell casually. Even without extra force, to soldiers under the finger, it was like a mountain falling from the sky. Under this heavy pressure, their exoskeleton armor screamed in agony after lasting seconds. Guards watched helplessly as armor embedded into flesh, only watching their arms and legs snap like branches under pressure. Bone cracking sounds rang like firecrackers. Bloody marrow crawled out of bodies like maggots. Human bodies losing support folded from the waist and passed out directly. As the finger pad pressed down slowly, soldiers who let go early wanting to live were trapped in a cage made of companions' corpses, finally heading to the same ending as companions under heavy pressure. Her fingernails were covered with bone fragments and iron filings. When the finger lifted again, only sticky threads of flesh mixture linked to the ground like spider webs.\n\nSurrounding soldiers seeing from the corner of their eyes couldn't control vomiting. Most importantly, when they looked at the maiden causing all this, they found only faint pride and disgust for small folk flesh on her face.\n\nTo wipe the flesh off her hand, Xinuo poked her finger into the ground, lifting the road like a bulldozer, cutting off the small folk and buildings ahead from the waist, crushing them all under her finger. In the end, the veteran crawled to save people but could only stare at the deep pit smeared with flesh, not knowing why he had to suffer such pain. Crushed like a bug for fighting for freedom.\n\nJust listening to the veteran's description, everyone's mind overflowed with fear. Unable to bear the pressure, they fired the first shot bringing death in despair. Losing large-caliber weapons, the attack was just lighting a few fireworks on the maiden's skin. Bullets hitting the skin collapsed into a ball due to acceleration and fell from the still smooth skin. The defenders' attack was completely pathetic useless effort."

 # §B“哎”§!\n\n希诺摇了摇头为这些小人的愚蠢而感到悲哀，不过他们何等悲哀也并不阻止自己接下来进行的工作，她张开嘴下达最后通牒\n\n§B“看起来你们还是不明白，不过父亲说遇到这种情况，我可以小小的展示一下力量，那么，失礼了~”§!\n\n希诺没有犹豫的对着开火的阵地伸出百米长的手掌，在小人面前表演性质的用食指抵着拇指蜷缩蓄力，给了小人逃跑和慌乱的时间，希诺看着那些米粒般大小的守军，哪怕是自己有意给予他们一分钟的时间，在自己眼中还是如乌龟一般待在原地。止不住的从嘴角露出欢快的轻笑。\n\n自己搭建的掩体这时反而成了守军阻碍，累的满头大汗的在掩体腾挪，这点时间只够跑出五十多米，还不如少女小拇指的距离，对这样怠惰的逃跑，希诺打算稍稍的“激励”一下，轻咳几声，感受守军的目光都汇聚到自己脸上，希诺才贴心的一字一句温柔安慰；§B“不会有痛苦的。”§!言尽食指就带着突破音障的轰鸣向守军踢去。\n\n手指未到，远方楼房被推动的空气碾压出出手指状的凹痕，没有固定的车辆和路灯被连绵气浪掀翻，如子弹般抛射出去接连贯穿十几层墙体，动力耗尽楼房才终于把它拦下，沿途楼房亦然千疮百孔，布满肉眼可见的窟窿可以直观的看见深埋在水泥里的钢筋，下一秒便在振动中层层坍塌被气流吹飞到立方土都没有留下，灾害范围如多米诺骨牌不断扩大。守军徒劳的抓住沿途的一切想要活命，但还未做到少女的手指便到了眼前。\n\n刚才手指没入地面，把沥青夯实的街道像豆腐一样切开，传来的震动让守军摔倒在地面。只能在绝望中被蔓延的裂缝吞没，不过这已经称得上幸运，眨眼间手指带着地铁的残片和躲在庇护所小人的碎末从地里钻出。直接接触的守军瞬间挤扁成紧贴在指腹上的肉饼，体液和器官像牙膏从皮囊挤出，最后堆积成的干枯的千层肉饼。\n\n后面的守军连被少女手指直接杀死的机会都没有。只能成为黏附在手指前方，变成山遗骸的一部分，城市的遗骸和小人层层叠加，到手指停下，堆积出一座新的山脉当作纪念碑来承托着后方轻抵的白皙手指，是何等的强大。\n\n§B“现在有谁想要投降嘛”§!\n\n希诺有意用带着灰尘的食指在小人头顶上不断起伏，挑逗着溃败的守军哀嚎连连，除了不愿意造成更多伤亡的仁慈，她停下来为了减少生产设施和资源的破坏，同时验收一下自己行动的成果，如果还是那么顽固，她不介意继续在城市里动动“手指”。\n\n在这样的威胁下，大部分人已经沉默，除了都市中心以都市象征作为最后据点的反抗军领袖还进行着最后的抵抗，继续无用的炮火在少女身上点亮朵朵火花。\n\n§B“既然还有人需要教育，那我只能再稍稍失礼一下了。”§!\n\n少女猛的站直掀起的飓风再一次把周围的人吹的人仰马翻，有些小人扶摇直上十几尺，落回坚硬的地面滚动几圈抽搐几下，除了从扭曲的四肢流出血液便不再动弹。那些经过几层筛选活下来的幸运儿，还来不及为自己活下来而感到欢呼，头顶上再一次被阴影笼罩，原来是希诺少女脱下高跟，用手掌轻拍高跟鞋侧，把黏附在上面的城市遗骸抖落回生育起的地方，希诺此举本是对这些守军的敬意和怜悯，知道脚下的不多的守军因为自己的举动再次死伤大半，肯定会为自己的粗心懊恼半天。\n\n出于礼数考虑，对于小人的家乡，希诺直接穿鞋进入自认为不成体统，所以才弯膝拖鞋把鞋子整齐码在城市的边缘，正是这个举动让她发现在山脉中搭建的隐秘基地，希诺微笑多分狡黠，如同做坏事孩子悄悄把山脉调整为鞋跟的落点\n\n高邦鞋跟如热刀切黄油般切开山丘，把躲藏在山里欢呼的守军用鞋跟打着转的捣碎成泥浆，之后手指松开鞋帮看着鞋后跟把山脉压低百米，之后缓缓落下的前脚掌顺带把稀疏的楼房和农田一并扫平，想着自己的两双鞋只是放下就把城郊的存在完全抹除，甚至城郊的形状还完美贴合自己的鞋型一寸不多。希诺被如此的巧合逗的掩面欢笑，那些好不容易逃离在鞋边喘气的小人，她接下来的玩笑把他们气的差点当成气死，希诺难言欢愉的向他们道谢\n\n§B“谢谢，你们为我准备的鞋柜，很合适哦。”§!\n\n不管小人的反应，希诺就折回城市边缘\n\n§B“刚刚穿鞋进入别人家有失礼数，现在我要进来了，多多打扰。”§!\n\n少女微微欠身向着恐慌的小人鞠躬行礼，不等小人的尖声拒绝。黑色死亡包裹着的脚掌带着刚沾上的农田淤泥的潮湿就结实的落在城市的边缘。\n\n只是落足产生的激荡就足以把街道掀翻，以落脚点化作层层岩石雕刻的花朵。不止如此街道也容纳不下落下的脚掌，周围的楼房也被踩塌半边，坍塌的地基使周围的楼房都向路上倾倒，家具从破损的洞口如雨点般落下，粉碎在白丝脚背按摩希诺的足穴，舒服的让希诺脚掌轻轻抓地，把崩解的地面用足弓搓碎反复摩擦足底，感受大大小小碎块逐渐被磨碎成粉尘，直到都碾碎成粉尘才用脚掌踏实，或许用足跟落地用脚掌猛地撞击周围的楼房，把其从中间劈开，弹飞房屋的上半截把隔壁的房屋一并击碎。随后前脚掌落地吧下半截带着地基碾成齑粉。\n\n希诺有意避开逃脱的车辆，在不伤害的前提下在他们眼前肆意的摧毁着人们熟悉的街道，踢碎，踏平，用前脚掌推倒再一路磨碎，车辆和人流只能眼睁睁的看着自己的房屋变成少女足底的黏附的粉尘，还有六期贷款的车辆也变成薄薄铁片。看着耗资千万的高楼群见被脚趾轻柔夹住，钢筋水泥制作的外墙被野蛮的侵入，冰凉的触感希诺发出如猫一般的呼噜声，为了消暑而上下揉搓，如同用舌尖舔舐冰棒，随着家具和墙体层层迸裂，最后只剩下将要倾覆的支撑柱孤零零的留在原地，而还没享受爽的希诺不快的用脚趾把其直接夹断，恶狠狠地补上一脚。\n\n每次落足都是对城市尊严的摧毁，但哪怕耳朵都被震的生疼，心里用最恶毒的语言咒骂，也没人真的对少女做出实际的反抗，欢愉的毁灭和悲伤的流窜，如此荒诞的一幕就在这里不断上演。而希诺只是高高在上的观赏这一切，用语言的力量把人们精神上最后遮羞布也扯碎\n\n§B“真是不错的按摩垫，不过有点太易碎，只能用一次呢~”§!\n\n五分钟可以到达的距离，在希诺的嬉戏下多花了五倍的时间，这点时间也把人们最后一点反抗精神完全磨灭，而现在正是审判这最后的反抗精神图腾的时候，希诺俯视着守军驻守的都市标志建筑物，五百米的高度还不及她的膝盖，希诺弯腰蹲下，看到每个守军拿着武器，无声的和自己对峙，表达自己决不投降的决心。\n\n§B“那再见了”§!\n\n言尽，希诺鼓起脸颊分泌口水用舌头不断搅动口中的空气，想要之后的吐息更湿润几分，此时守军自知终点以至，全部也失力的瘫倒在原地，一分钟，少女才张开红润晶莹如宝石般饱满的双唇，让自己湿润的吐息慢慢飘到建筑上，灼热而湿润的吐息遇到冰冷的建筑而迅速液化，不过刹那整个街道都弥漫着带着希诺香味的水雾，浓厚的迷雾伸手不见五指，尤其是守军已经完全看不见外面的情况。\n\n作为对这些坚守到最后的守军，希诺准备用最特别的方式来结束他们的生命，闭目凝神翅膀浮现出星座般璀璨神秘的图案，双手合并于胸口，随着光芒不断从指缝泄露，手掌慢慢摊开。如太阳般闪耀的能量块静静躺在手掌的中心，把晶体朝向建筑希诺轻轻把接下来的吐息一并送出。\n\n那闪耀的结晶其实是压缩太阳光热到极限的能量晶体，少女湿润的吐息通过的瞬间就加热成能融化钢铁的上千度蒸汽，和建筑接触瞬间表面的口水丝瞬间气化，守军只感到周围一瞬间热的如同蒸笼，鞋子迅速软化成粘稠的凝胶，失去保护足底瞬间被滚烫如烙铁的地面把烤熟，皮肤也在高温中顺速失去水分，无烟燃烧到起皮焦褐。\n\n在极致的痛苦之后，连神经都被烧断的瞬间疼痛才被蜘蛛，守军才勉强可以观察四周，没想到一眼就看到超现实的场景，发现连墙上的混泥土都被烧成焦炭，裸露的钢筋都烧的通红，原本包裹严实的建筑半边在炙烤下已经液化，气化。从那半塌的建筑里守军能直视少女柔软的红唇，和再一次直视那沾满天空的黄色龙瞳，这次对视没有仇恨只有守军用眼神无声的哀求。\n\n§B“呼”§!\n\n满意的希诺终于把储存的吐息一口吐尽，把那迅速焦化成脆弱灰烬的建筑和守军同时吹碎成满天烟尘，周围目击到这一切的小人已经说不出话，扑通一声从第一个开始膜拜的小人开始传染，所有逃难的人都放在手头，向面前的存在表达臣服，而少女只是默默的享受这份荣誉。
 gts_xinuo.16.desc:0 "§B\"Sigh\"§!\n\nXinuo shook her head, feeling sad for these small folks' stupidity. But however sad they were, it didn't stop her upcoming work. She opened her mouth to issue the final ultimatum\n\n§B\"Looks like you still don't understand. But Father said in this situation, I can show a little power. So, excuse me~\"§!\n\nXinuo didn't hesitate to extend a hundred-meter-long palm towards the firing position, performing a demonstration of curling index finger against thumb to charge up in front of small folk, giving them time to run and panic. Xinuo looked at those grain-sized defenders. Even with a minute given intentionally, in her eyes, they stayed put like turtles. She couldn't stop a cheerful chuckle from leaking from the corner of her mouth.\n\nThe shelter they built became an obstacle for defenders now. Moving in the shelter exhausted and sweating, this time was only enough to run fifty meters, not even the distance of the maiden's little finger. For such lazy escape, Xinuo planned to \"encourage\" a little. Coughing gently, feeling defenders' gazes gathering on her face, Xinuo comforted tenderly word by word: §B\"There won't be pain.\"§! Saying so, the index finger kicked towards defenders with a sonic boom.\n\nFinger not yet arrived, distant buildings were crushed with finger-shaped dents by pushed air. Unsecured vehicles and street lamps were overturned by continuous air waves, ejected like bullets piercing through a dozen walls, stopped only when momentum ran out. Buildings along the way were riddled with holes, rebar buried deep in concrete visible to naked eyes. In the next second, they collapsed layer by layer in vibration, blown away by airflow without leaving a cubic of earth. Disaster range expanded like dominoes. Defenders futilely grabbed everything along the way trying to survive, but the maiden's finger arrived before they could.\n\nThe finger just sank into the ground, cutting the asphalt-compacted street like tofu. The transmitted vibration made defenders fall. They could only be swallowed by spreading cracks in despair. But this was considered lucky. In a blink, the finger drilled out of the ground carrying subway fragments and dust of small folk hiding in shelters. Defenders in direct contact were instantly squashed into meat patties sticking to the finger pad. Fluids and organs squeezed out of skin bags like toothpaste, finally piling up into dry mille-feuille meat patties.\n\nDefenders behind didn't even have the chance to be killed directly by the maiden's finger. The could only become part of the mountain remains sticking to the front of the finger. City remains and small folk stacked layer by layer. When the finger stopped, a new mountain range piled up as a monument to support the white finger resting lightly behind. How powerful.\n\n§B\"Anyone want to surrender now?\"§!\n\nXinuo intentionally moved her dusty index finger up and down over small folk's heads, teasing the routed defenders into wailing. Except for the kindness of not wanting to cause more casualties, she stopped to reduce destruction of production facilities and resources, and inspect the results of her action. If still so stubborn, she wouldn't mind moving her \"finger\" in the city again.\n\nUnder such threat, most people fell silent. Except for the resistance leader using the city symbol in the center as the last stronghold, continuing final resistance. Continuing useless artillery fire lighting up flowers on the maiden.\n\n§B\"Since some people still need education, I have to excuse myself a little more.\"§!\n\nThe maiden stood up straight abruptly. The raised hurricane blew people around over again. Some small folk soared up a dozen feet, rolled a few times falling back to hard ground, twitched a few times, and stopped moving except for blood flowing from twisted limbs. Those lucky ones surviving several layers of screening, barely cheered for survival, when shadows covered overhead again. It turned out Xinuo took off her high heels, gently patted the side of the high heel with her palm to shake off city remains stuck on it back to where they grew. Xinuo's act was respect and pity for these defenders. Knowing the few remaining defenders under her feet died or got injured again due to her action, she would definitely be annoyed for a long time for her carelessness.\n\nOut of etiquette, entering small folk's home with shoes on, Xinuo considered it improper, so she bent her knees to take off shoes and neatly stacked them on the edge of the city. Precisely this act made her discover the hidden base built in the mountains. Xinuo smiled with a bit of cunning, secretly adjusting the mountain range as the landing point for the heel like a child doing bad things\n\nThe high-top heel cut open the hill like a hot knife cutting butter, crushing defenders cheering in hiding into mud with the heel spinning. Then fingers released the shoe upper, watching the heel press the mountain range down a hundred meters. Then the slowly landing forefoot swept flattened sparse buildings and farmland together. Thinking her pair of shoes just put down completely erased the existence of the suburb, and the suburb shape perfectly fitted her shoe shape without an inch difference. Xinuo was amused by such coincidence covering her face laughing. Those small folk who barely escaped panting by the shoe were almost angered to death by her next joke. Xinuo thanked them happily\n\n§B\"Thanks, the shoe cabinet you prepared for me fits very well.\"§!\n\nIgnoring small folk's reaction, Xinuo turned back to the city edge\n\n§B\"Entering someone's home with shoes on just now was rude. Now I'm coming in. Sorry for the intrusion.\"§!\n\nThe maiden bowed slightly to panic small folk. Not waiting for small folk's screaming refusal. Black death wrapped feet landed solidly on the city edge carrying the moisture of farm mud just stained.\n\nJust the shock generated by landing was enough to overturn streets, carving flowers of layered rocks at the landing point. More than that, streets couldn't accommodate the landing feet. Surrounding buildings were also trampled halfway collapsed. Collapsed foundation made surrounding buildings lean towards the road. Furniture fell like rain from broken holes, shattering on the white silk instep massaging Xinuo's foot acupoints, comfortable enough for Xinuo to gently grab the ground with toes, rubbing the disintegrated ground with her arch, feeling large and small fragments gradually ground into dust. Stepping solid only after grinding all into dust. Perhaps landing with heel, slamming the forefoot into surrounding buildings, splitting them from the middle, bouncing off the upper half of the house to smash the next house. Then forefoot landing crushing the lower half with foundation into powder.\n\nXinuo intentionally avoided escaping vehicles, wantonly destroying familiar streets in front of them without hurting them. Kicking, trampling flat, pushing down with forefoot then grinding all the way. Vehicles and traffic could only watch their houses turned into dust sticking to the maiden's sole, and vehicles with six-term loans turned into thin iron sheets. Watching high-rise groups costing tens of millions being gently clamped by toes. External walls made of reinforced concrete were savagely invaded. Cool touch made Xinuo purr like a cat. Rubbing up and down to relieve heat, like licking a popsicle with tongue tip. As furniture and walls cracked layer by layer, finally only toppling pillars remained lonely in place. And Xinuo, not yet enjoying enough, unhappily clamped them off directly with toes, adding a fierce kick.\n\nEvery step was destruction of city dignity. But even with ears hurting from shock, cursing with most vicious language in heart, no one really made actual resistance to the maiden. Joyful destruction and sad fleeing, such absurd scene played out here constantly. And Xinuo just watched all this from high above, tearing apart the last fig leaf of people's spirit with the power of language\n\n§B\"Really nice massage pad, but a bit too fragile, only use once~\"§!\n\nDistance reachable in five minutes took five times longer under Xinuo's play. This time also completely wore down people's last bit of resistance spirit. And now was the time to judge this last resistance spirit totem. Xinuo looked down at the city landmark building defended by guards. Five hundred meters height not reaching her knee. Xinuo bent down to squat, seeing every guard holding weapons, confronting silently, expressing determination never to surrender.\n\n§B\"Then goodbye\"§!\n\nSaying so, Xinuo puffed up cheeks secreting saliva, tongue constantly churning air in mouth, wanting subsequent breath wetter. At this time defenders knew the end had come, all collapsed weakly on spot. One minute, the maiden opened rosy crystal-like plump lips, letting her moist breath slowly float to the building. Hot and moist breath liquefied quickly upon meeting cold building. In an instant whole street filled with water mist carrying Xinuo's scent. Thick fog beyond arm's reach, especially defenders could no longer see outside.\n\nAs the most special way to end the lives of these defenders who held out to the last, Xinuo closed eyes to concentrate, wings emerging chaotic mysterious patterns like constellations. Hands joined at chest. As light constantly leaked from finger gaps, palms slowly spread. Energy block shining like sun lay quietly in palm center. Aiming crystal at building, Xinuo gently sent subsequent breath together.\n\nThat shining crystal was actually energy crystal of compressed sunlight and heat to limit. The moment maiden's moist breath passed, it heated into thousands of degrees steam capable of melting steel. Contacting building, surface saliva threads instantly vapurized. Defenders only felt surrounding instantly hot as steamer. Shoes quickly softened into sticky gel. Losing protection, soles were cooked by ground hot as branding iron instantly. Skin also lost moisture rapidly in high temperature, burning smokelessly to peeling and charring.\n\nAfter extreme pain, nerves burned meant pain stopped. Defenders could barely observe surroundings. Unexpectedly seeing surreal scene at a glance. Finding even concrete on wall burned to charcoal. Exposed rebar burned red. Originally tightly wrapped building half liquefied, gasified under roasting. From that half-collapsed building defenders could look directly at maiden's soft red lips, and look directly at those yellow dragon pupils staining the sky again. This eye contact had no hatred, only defenders' silent pleading with eyes.\n\n§B\"Phew\"§!\n\nSatisfied Xinuo finally exhaled stored breath completely, blowing that building rapidly charred into fragile ash and defenders simultaneously into sky-filling dust. Surrounding small folk witnessing all this could not speak. With a thud spreading from the first worshiping small folk, all fleeing people put down tasks, expressing submission to the existence in front. And the maiden just silently enjoyed this honor."

 # 恒星的光辉照耀了这颗星球数亿年之久，但今天东半球的人们却没有如往常一样等来那温暖的阳光，反而是深深的黑暗将天幕笼罩，躁动的人们尝试着揭开这神秘的面纱，但消息仿佛被完全封锁了一般，没有任何可靠消息能流出。\n\n§B“嗯……看起来不错。”§!\n\n降临于此处的希诺似乎完全没有意识到自己对星球上的人们造成了多大的影响，数万米长的舌尖轻轻从红润的嘴唇上划过，淡淡的香气侵入了星球的大气，放大了数百万倍的气味让星球上的人们陷入了迷醉之中，突然传出的卫星影像在人们的设备中循环播放着希诺的身姿，无数人对着天空朝拜，他们坚信着这是女神救世的征兆，即使广播早已发出避难的信号，但城市中还是密密麻麻的分布着数亿人类狂热的呼唤着女神，而逃命的人流也被这拥挤的街道困住，无助地看着那巨大的红色怪兽向星球落下。\n\n“砰！”随着舌尖重重落下，强烈的冲击搅乱了星球的气流，飓风以舌尖为中心席卷整颗星球，所有的飞行器被这恐怖的气流所击落，而舌尖所在的位置已经被压出一个深坑，三十万人的尸骸与城市碎屑被顺流而下的唾液所填满，而远在宇宙中的希诺只是闭着眼睛感受着生命能量的流入。\n\n粉红色的怪兽停止了，至少地面上的小人们是这么认为的，祈祷着这无边的舌尖离开的小人们燃起了求生的信念，而军队的攻击产生的点点爆炸让地面上的人们也重新看到了希望，但，随着一颗弹道导弹的攻击，希诺突然颤抖了一下，带动着舌尖搅碎了周围的一整片城市，意料之外的攻击将城市中的数百万人碾成碎片，并且从卫星影像看起来，这位女神微微蹙眉，似乎对刚刚的意外非常不满。\n\n§B“好吧，本来不想这么快结束的。”§!\n\n震耳欲聋的神音再次从天幕之上传来，希诺再次将舌尖接触着大地，而这一次，她没有等待，只是轻轻从星球上舔过，而那最宽广的大陆在被舌尖扫过后，只剩下被唾液覆盖的褐色的土壤，幸存的军队尝试着阻挡天灾，不过绝对的力量不是寥寥的勇气能平衡，他们也只能无助的射击，在舌面上打出一个个小小的火花，然后与脚下的土地一起成为希诺的养分。\n\n§B“嗯~”§!\n\n看着自己在星球表面留下的艺术，希诺满意的点了点头，至少现在她已经很满足了，虽然近一半的星球地标、[owner.gts_event_kills_logs]个小人和[owner.gts_event_city_kills_logs]座城市已经被希诺所舔舐殆尽，但这些小人们还真得感谢自己，照以前那样，这颗星球早就被自己吃进嘴里了，只吃了一半已经很给克制了，满意地摸了摸自己的肚子，希诺瞬间消失在了星系之中，只留下无助的小人们在这地狱般的大地上重建家园。
 gts_xinuo.19.desc:0 "Starlight shone on this planet for hundreds of millions of years. But today people in the Eastern Hemisphere didn't wait for that warm sunlight as usual. Instead deep darkness covered the sky canopy. Restless people tried to uncover this mysterious veil, but news seemed completely blocked, no reliable news flowed out.\n\n§B\"Hmm... looks good.\"§!\n\nXinuo descending here seemed completely unaware of how much impact she caused to people on the planet. Tens of thousands of meters long tongue tip gently swept across rosy lips. Faint scent invaded planet atmosphere. Scent amplified millions of times intoxicated people on planet. Suddenly transmitted satellite image played Xinuo's figure in loop on people's devices. Countless people worshiped the sky, believing this was sign of goddess saving the world. Even if broadcast already issued evacuation signal, city still densely distributed hundreds of millions of humans feverishly calling goddess. And fleeing stream trapped by crowded streets, helplessly watching that huge red monster falling towards planet.\n\n\"Bang!\" As tongue tip fell heavily, strong impact disturbed planet airflow. Hurricane swept entire planet centering tongue tip. All aircraft shot down by terrifying airflow. And tongue tip location pressed into deep pit. 300,000 corpses and city debris filled by saliva flowing down. While Xinuo far in space just closed eyes feeling life energy inflow.\n\nPink monster stopped. At least small folk on ground thought so. Small folk praying for boundless tongue tip to leave ignited will to survive. And army attacks producing little explosions let people on ground see hope again. But, with a ballistic missile attack, Xinuo trembled suddenly, driving tongue tip to crush a whole surrounding city. Unexpected attack crushed millions in city into pieces. And from satellite image, this goddess frowned slightly, seemingly very dissatisfied with accident just now.\n\n§B\"Well, didn't want to end so fast.\"§!\n\nDeafening divine voice came from above sky canopy again. Xinuo touched earth with tongue tip again. And this time, she didn't wait, just gently licked across planet. And that widest continent, after being swept by tongue tip, left only brown soil covered by saliva. Surviving army tried to block natural disaster. But absolute power isn't balanced by sparse courage. They could only shoot helplessly, hitting small sparks on tongue surface, then becoming Xinuo's nutrient along with land under feet.\n\n§B\"Mmm~\"§!\n\nLooking at art she left on planet surface, Xinuo nodded satisfied. At least now she is satisfied. Although nearly half of planet landmarks, [owner.gts_event_kills_logs] small folk and [owner.gts_event_city_kills_logs] cities have been licked clean by Xinuo. But these small folk really should thank her. Like before, this planet would have been eaten by her long ago. Eating only half is already very restrained. Satisfied touching her belly, Xinuo disappeared in galaxy instantly, leaving only helpless small folk to rebuild homes on this hellish earth."

 gts_xinuo.302.desc:0 "§H\"Warning! Warning! Abnormal energy fluctuation detected!\"§!\n\nAfter cracking the shackles inside Xinuo's body, alarms suddenly blared in the institute. A blue light ball formed inside Xinuo's cryo pod. Terrible high temperature completely burned the cryo pod, but the maiden's body was wrapped intact inside. Active blue energy constantly flowed into the maiden's body. Her size expanded at speed visible to naked eye. Solid outer wall was smashed a big hole by maiden's body. But maiden didn't stop growing, instead crushing several adjacent blocks amidst gasps.\n\n§B\"Hmph... ah, woah!!!\"§!\n\nXinuo, whose size had expanded to a thousand times, hurriedly stopped her energy absorption. But at this time over 50,000 people had been turned into meat mud by her body, sleeping forever in soil. If she hadn't stopped growing, perhaps more areas would have suffered.\n\nBut even more incredible thing appeared. That faint blue light appeared in Xinuo's dimming bloodline again, injected underground along body. Whole city was wrapped by a wonderful magic circle, imprinted on earth like constellations in sky. Blurred flesh and collapsed buildings were re-aggregated and shaped by this magical power, returning to original state.\n\n§B\"That's great...\"§!\n\nIt seems Xinuo breathed a sigh of relief. Then, energy flowing on earth returned to Xinuo's body at flying speed.\n\n§B\"That...\"§!\n\nLooking at experimental building destroyed by herself, Xinuo extended legs from gap, gently patted stains sticking to legs, re-guiding energy, seemingly slowly familiarizing with her power.\n\nReshaped experimental building was covered with a protective shell, seemingly sturdier than before.
