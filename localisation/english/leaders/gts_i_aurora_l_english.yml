  NAME_gts_aurora: "Aurora"
  DESC_gts_aurora: "Aurora, who was in a sleeping state, created a psionic clone identical to her main body to facilitate communication. Because she does not have the habit of wearing clothes, she often takes off her clothes in public places and needs to be supervised at all times."

  gts_aurora.998.b.response: "(Aurora showed a hint of sadness) I became like this...... because of a curse, my country, and the whole world, were destroyed because of me.

  gts_aurora.1032.name: "Titan Loli"
  gts_aurora.1032.desc: "This super giant loli doesn't look very happy; she seems very dissatisfied with being woken up from her slumber. And almost in an instant, she looked towards the location of our science ship, and then, she stretched out a \"delicate hand.\" The ship didn't even have time to accelerate before being captured by the gravity produced by her \"small hand.\" We could only watch helplessly as the ship was pinched between two fingers, watching the dizzying, giant fingerprint valleys slowly close. Just when everyone thought they were about to valiantly sacrifice themselves, the movement of her fingers suddenly stopped. Then a psionic signal, so powerful it almost burned out the communication receiver, was sent to us."

  gts_aurora.1050.name: "Break Free"
  gts_aurora.1050.desc: "For some reason, the psionic reaction within this giant loli suddenly increased dramatically. The powerful psionic fluctuations attacked various colonies within her giant body and created psionic projections that looked identical to her. If we do not take action quickly, these projections will soon enter the physical world and destroy the restraining devices."
  gts_aurora.1050.a: "Suppress her with all our might!"
  gts_aurora.1051.name: "Short-Term Anesthesia"
  gts_aurora.1051.desc: "We have temporarily suppressed the psionic fluctuations by overloading the restraints, but this is only temporary.  No matter how much we increase the power, the energy fluctuations still exist.  Our scientists believe that the restraints can only control the activity of the giantess's body. To fully solve the problem, we must also control the activity of her brain."
  gts_aurora.1051.a: "Slaves do not need their own thoughts, let's completely brainwash her!"
  gts_aurora.1052.name: "Absolute Obedience"
  gts_aurora.1052.desc: "With the activation of the powerful mind-control device, every nerve in the loli's gigantic body is now under our control, and her last resistance is nothing more than a few tears and a scream. We shall conquer everything!"

  gts_aurora.1054.name: "Silent Departure"
  gts_aurora.1054.desc: "The shackles are broken, and powerful psionic energy spread throughout the entire star system, but the psionic shock we expected did not come. Only a slightly sorrowful tune echoed within the star system. At the end of the song, in the blink of an eye, the planetary-sized young girl disappeared into thin air, like she was never there.  Fortunately, all of our colonists were transported to the capital and had no recollection of colonizing on the loli."
  gts_aurora.1054.a: "Let this matter be dropped and seal the file in the database permanently."
  gts_aurora.1055.name: "No More Dreams"
  gts_aurora.1055.desc: "After successfully controlling this giant young girl, our research on her body can continue. We further research and found that her brain contains unknown knowledge from various ancient advanced civilizations, some even older than the Fallen Empires. In order to better conduct research and prevent similar break-free incidents from happening again, we decided to strip her main consciousness and put it into a small clone we created. Then use a jamming device to sever her connection with the main body. Such a humanoid supercomputer that will never be out of control will always serve us."

  aurora_digsite_desc: "Preliminary surveys show that the civilization on this planet was destroyed in a global war. This is nothing unusual for pre-FTL native civilizations, but this planet has a significant number of rare artifacts, therefore we should establish a dedicated archaeological project and conduct a planned excavation."
  gts_aurora.1000.name: "Secluded from the World"
  gts_aurora.1000.desc: "During a recent interstellar patrol, our scientists discovered a star system not previously marked on any maps. Subsequently, we discovered that this star system has no connection to any hyperspace lanes. Perhaps this is the reason why it wasn't marked on the maps. Although from the scan results, this star system does not seem to have any anomalies, many of our scientists have developed a strong interest in it."
  gts_aurora.1000.a: "Then let them study it."
  gts_aurora.1001.name: "Non-Native Species"
  gts_aurora.1001.desc: "During the excavation process, we found some historical documents regarding the previous civilization's species on this planet. Strangely, the content recorded in these documents does not coincide with the planet's evolutionary process. It seems that these sentient species suddenly appeared on this planet, but the technological level of these natives was clearly not advanced enough to conduct interstellar colonization."
  gts_aurora.1001.a: "Interesting, forget about the artifacts, investigate this matter thoroughly."
  gts_aurora.1002.name: "Witch Hunt"
  gts_aurora.1002.desc: "Through further investigation, we discovered that this sentient species was born with a certain degree of psionic potential, but they do not have any technology related to psionics. In more historical documents we found later, we discovered this species, for some reason, were extremely wary of psionics, with an extreme culture that forbids psionics. There were even cases of concentrating individuals with strong psionic abilities for execution. Perhaps this is related to the reason why this species came to this planet."
  gts_aurora.1002.a: "Interesting, continue digging!"
  gts_aurora.1003.name: "Familiar Terminology"
  gts_aurora.1003.desc: "Through relentless excavation and research, we finally determined that this species had reached around the medieval period when they were transferred to this planet.

  gts_aurora.1004.desc: "As the research reached a dead end, one of our exploration teams discovered a strange cave. The cave was not very large, but it had signs that people had lived there. Judging from the furnishings, it should have been built in the era when they were transferred to the planet. Here, we found a notebook sealed in crystal, and the content of the book is shocking."

Even the fairies were happy about the princess's birth, and they came to the palace to offer their blessings.\n\n\"Look! How cute her chubby cheeks are! She will surely grow into a great beauty! I wish her a healthy growth, to become a star that attracts everyone's attention!\"\n\n\"Hey, look at her eyes, they are as watery and lively as the morning dew. I wish that you can be free like a dandelion, without any constraints.\"\n\nBut the next second, a wicked fairy broke into the palace.\n\n\"Growth? Freedom? I shall turn these blessings into her curse! Into an uncontrolled power! She will be twisted by this power, becoming a monster! After 10 years, she will destroy this filthy kingdom for me!\"\n\nThe malicious curse fell upon the newborn princess, and the evil fairy disappeared into sneers and black smoke. The lively venue instantly became as silent as a funeral. Finally, the third fairy, who had yet to give her blessing, broke the silence.\n\n\"Although I cannot break the curse, I want to give the little princess the ability to trust others. I hope this will help her.\""

The Queen even thought the curse had disappeared, and Aurora would continue to grow in happiness and love. That's until a maid discovered that the princess's hair had changed to an abnormal color. It has been 8 years. Perhaps this is the sign, the ministers discussed. The king bowed his head and remained silent, while the Queen was placed under house arrest in her bedroom, crying all day long. Aurora thought that her mother would scold her for dyeing her hair with berries. After all, her mother, who usually spoiled Aurora the most, would become extremely strict when it came to grooming problems. But that day, her mother did not appear. Instead, her father came to tell her a bedtime story in the evening,. His deep but trembling voice made her very curious. But the excess energy she used up during the day quickly sent her to sleep, and in a haze, she saw a shiny silver star.\n\nThat night, Aurora had a nightmare. She felt a searing pain in her chest, and she was in the dark, trying to cry out but could not make a sound. When she finally woke up, she found that the surrounding scenery had become unfamiliar - large areas of sunken ground, ruins of the palace, and faint screams coming from afar. The strange scenery, combined with last night's nightmare, made Aurora feel extremely uneasy. She ran and shouted her mother's name, but not far out, she saw her father kneeling on the ground, with her mother lying in his arms. She walked over and softly called to her mother, but there was no response, and there would never be a response."

She is destroying everything like a monster, and the soldiers' weapons cannot even scratch her skin! Some soldiers were even used as snacks and buried in the belly of the princess! Even the queen was killed by her own hands!\"\n\nAll kinds of rumors were constantly spreading in the civil community. But Aurora was not worried about returning to the palace, because her father told her that he would come to pick her up when the palace was repaired. Besides, for her, life in the tower was no different from life in the palace, except that there were no maids or her mother's company.\n\nWithout anyone to accompany her, she read the books in the tower and talked to the little animals. She would often read stories from the books to the little animals that gathered around her, and her favorite was the story of a hero saving a princess imprisoned in a tower. Two months later, Aurora's fantasy became a reality. She saw someone with a weapon climbing in through the window of the tower.\n\n\"Brave hero-sama! Are you the brave hero-sama! Have you come to take Aurora away! Eh? Why did you draw your sword? Monster...... But there are no monsters guarding this place?\"\n\nAurora saw the sharp blade slash towards her neck, and then, she had that nightmare again. After waking up, the room was a mess, and for some reason, there was a hole in the ceiling.\n\n\"It was a dream, brave hero-sama would not hurt the princess.\"\n\n After that day, Aurora would often have such \"nightmares\", but strangely, every time she woke up, Aurora felt like her stomach was full."

It is time to act.\nDay 1: The princess seems somewhat wary. Perhaps I was a little too hasty. I will ask about the full body checkup for the princess tomorrow.\nDay 7: After observation, the princess' mind has clearly not been affected by the curse. But the princess still has not agreed to a full body checkup. Using some raspberry cake as bait might be a good option.\nDay 16: The princess has made it very clear about her attitude towards full body checkups. But she was able to crush the bricks of the tower walls with her bare hands. Perhaps the research has a direction now. In addition, the raspberry cake made by the princess tastes very good.\nDay 21: With consent, I extracted some blood samples from the princess. I found that the amount of magical power in the princess' body was shockingly high, but this magical power does not come from the curse, but innate. This means that the curse will only make this power difficult to control. Perhaps it is not necessary to break the curse. If we let the princess learn to control this power, maybe we can save the princess.\nDay 53: It has been over a month since the control training began. Now the princess can skillfully control her power and can even expand her body to a certain extent. Perhaps the princess will soon be able to return to a normal life, and the task entrusted to me by the queen can finally be completed.\nDay 59: The pigeons sent to the palace have not flown back. Could something have happened to the palace?\nDay 90: So much time has passed, but the letters sent to the palace are still nowhere to be found. We can't delay any longer. It seems that I should go there myself.\n(The following is a section written in a more formal font) Grandpa said that he would be back soon, but it has been two months, and Grandpa has not come back yet. So Aurora wrote this letter, hoping that you can come back soon. Aurora has made a lot of raspberry cake waiting for Grandpa to come back and eat!"

Perhaps she had become so used to having someone with her, she was bored with this endless wait for the first time. However, half a year had passed, and there was still no news of the amiable old grandpa. One early morning, a clamor of voices suddenly came from near the remote tower.\n\n\"Is that grandpa? Has he come to take me home?\"\n\nSuppressing the excitement in her heart, Aurora, imitating her mother's previous actions, gently lifted her skirt and walked out with elegant steps. But what came into view was soldiers and mobs fully armed, and an old scholar held captive in a prison wagon.\n\n\"Burn the bewitching sorcerer to death!\"\n\"Don't be fooled by her looks, she is a man-eating monster!\"\n\"Burn her to death!\"\n\"That's the monster, still wearing the skin of the princess!\"\n\nConfusion, grievance, fear, disorientation, and suppressed emotions at this moment converged into a raging fire, burning in Aurora's heart.\n\n\"Why are you hurting grandpa! Why are you blaming me for everything!\"\n\nThe petite girl in the next instant became a giant that could shield the tower.\n\n\"Finally showing her true colors, monster!\"\n\"Kill it!\"\n\"For the future of the kingdom!\"\n\nAurora took a step forward. The solid ground was smashed into a deep pit by the girl's fair and delicate soles, and the gust of air lifted the charging soldiers. The high morale was instantly shattered by the little girl's stomp. People scattered and fled, but the huge sole did not fall onto the crowd. Aurora simply stepped over the crowd and walked to the prison wagon. Even in anger, Aurora still did not want to hurt anyone. All she wanted to do was to save the kind old scholar in front of her who was being tortured.\n\n\"She fell for it! Fire the arrows!\"\n\nThe siege crossbows ambushed on the side shot out huge arrows, and the enchanted arrowheads pierced through Aurora's chest. The searing pain in her chest made her recall the night her destiny had changed.\n\n\"So Aurora is the monster. No wonder everyone hates Aurora so much...\"\n\nA flash of light passed, the \"monster\" disappeared, but a more terrifying change took place. The dim sky covered by flesh-colored walls, the strong wind that uprooted large trees, and irregular earthquakes. Before people had a chance to celebrate, they were plunged back into a panic as if the end of the world had arrived. However, without any warning, the doomsday-like changes suddenly stopped. The entire kingdom was miraculously free from casualties. Other than the surrounding terrain becoming unfamiliar, nothing was abnormal. People emerged from the rubble and began to rebuild their homes. The kingdom was destroyed on this day, but it was not destroyed. The curse was finally fulfilled, but Aurora had already tried her best in her own way."

  gts_aurora.1080.desc: "§r Sorry, little ones……§!\n\nA booming voice echoed in the sky of [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName]. The girl's usual gentle and lovely voice was now as hopeless as a death knell from hell in the ears of the people of [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName]. Immediately after, an immeasurably huge figure appeared in the planet's orbit. Her flawless white face occupied the entire sky. Her emerald green pupils slowly scanned the entire continent. Whether it was the moss-like gray cities or the dust-like minuscule lives, in Aurora's eyes, they were now all seen as food.\n\n§r According to [Root.Ruler.GetName]'s request, this planet and everyone on it are all my food…! Although I am very sorry…but, please do be prepared to be eaten by me. §!\n\nAlthough the pitiful people of this planet, who were not able to evacuate or were not allowed to leave, had long known their fate, under the immense body of the celestial Aurora, an indescribable sense of oppression and panic completely enveloped the tiny people. For a moment, [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] was in chaos. The people who ran around blindly failed to realize that the most they could do was to escape from the area covered by Aurora's face to the sky covered by the girl's feet.\n\n§r If everyone has no objections… then I will begin ~ §! Aurora slightly closed her eyes and gently opened her \"small mouth\", drifting towards [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] little by little. The girl's breath, wrapped in a torrent of saliva, rushed towards the planet. The fragrant yet viscous liquid instantly enveloped the entire planet with Aurora's breath, forcefully replacing the atmosphere that had once been suitable on [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName]. Immediately following that, a torrent of saliva rain appeared in every district and building on the planet, eroding the fragile structures and the even smaller people. The population drowned in Aurora's saliva could no longer be calculated. That is how much the ecosystem of [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] had been destroyed by just a small exhale by the girl. Perhaps, this is the unique power of a celestial giantess?\n\n§r Ah-§! The slowly separating lips revealed a bottomless dark abyss behind them. If the survivors on [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] had the strength to look up, all they could see was the girl's mouth as massive as a star, with the rest of the space completely blocked by Aurora's lips and teeth. Immediately after, the tip of the girl's tongue trembled slightly and reached towards [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName]. With a few strands of saliva trailing behind, the tip of her tongue went straight into the ground. The soft, pink giant slowly moved across the continent, and everything it passed – whether it was towering mountains, solid buildings, or tiny little people – could not escape being swept by Aurora's huge tongue, being crushed under the soft flesh or stuck to the tongue.\n\n§r Mmm… delicious~!§! Aurora, still wanting more, gently receded a bit, slowly retracting her huge tongue. She then carefully savored the taste of [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] and the cities on it. The ancient crust and the industrial products of the people were quickly dissolved and submerged in the ocean of saliva, until it disappeared into the celestial size stomach after Aurora swallowed.  \n\n§r Glurp...Want more…! §! After swallowing this \"appetizer\" made from a whole continent, the adorable Aurora revealed a sweet smile. She then raised her fingers, which were larger than a battleship. She gently pinched the south and north poles of [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName], and the resulting tremors once again destroyed the few remaining settlements on the planet. Then, Aurora, who finally could not resist the temptation of \"food,\" slowly sent [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] into her mouth. The small planet that had once carried countless people's hopes disappeared into the mouth of a celestial giantess. Her nimble tongue sent the tiny planet between her white teeth. After chewing lightly a few times, Aurora carefully savored the mantle flowing out of her mouth and the core colliding with her teeth, and then silently swallowed it.\n\n§r Mmm~ It's like a chocolate with a filling ~! §! Smiling, Miss Aurora contentedly rubbed her tummy, humming a song that we have already familiar with, and left this star system. As for the final fate of [event_target:gts_nutrition_planet.GetName] and the people she ate, whether they were completely digested by stomach acid strong enough to extinguish the star or managed to get through the intestines that were longer than a ringworld and be excreted are not things our empire needs to be concerned about."

  d_gtsra_giga_slave_hole_desc: "The giantess is now under our control, and she no longer needs a functioning digestive tract. We have used a large number of resources to neutralize various corrosive glands to ensure the progress of development operations. Our processing plants are scattered throughout the giantess' anus and intestines, extracting endless rare resources day and night."
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_armpit: "Axillary Wetlands"
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_armpit_desc: "The rich body heat and pools of sweat in the armpits can be used as a good source of electricity."
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_brain_unexploit: "Brain Development"
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_brain_unexploit_desc: "Although the principle is unknown, the brain of this giantess contains a large amount of information and knowledge unknown to the Empire. We can directly transform parts of the brain tissue into a giant living database and establish a research center within the skull to contribute to the Empire's research."
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_pussy_unexploit: "Explore the Flesh Cave"
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_pussy_unexploit_desc: "A huge dark fleshy cavity, filled with warm mist. This is the softest and most mysterious place of the giantess' body, and we have dispatched a large number of ships to carry out a detailed development of its interior. Fortunately, after continuous exploration by the Empire's scientists, we seem to be able to establish factories here to collect some rare resources, but exactly what they are remains to be explored."
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_egg_unexploit: "Explore the Flower Bud"
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_egg_unexploit_desc: "While exploring inside the giantess' body, Imperial scientists discovered the reproductive organs that nurture enormous eggs.  They have applied for the use of a large number of resources through special channels to conduct secret breeding experiments."
  d_gtsra_giga_slave_hole_unexploit: "Intestinal Modification"

  d_gtsra_giga_slave_hole_unexploit_desc: "Although the giantess is now under our control, it is still very dangerous to establish mining bases inside her intestines. We still need to provide adequate training for our workers, and use a vast amount of resources to modify the intestinal tract that no longer needs a digestive function, to ensure the operation of the mining project."
