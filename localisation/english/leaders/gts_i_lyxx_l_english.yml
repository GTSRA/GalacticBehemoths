  gts_lyxx.1.title: "That's... a shadow?"
  gts_lyxx.1.desc: "After repeated scans and analyses by [owner_country.GetName]'s scientists, we've finally located the source of that psionic signal. It seems to originate from a completely dark area within the gravitational well of [from.solar_System.GetName].\n\nEven our most advanced detectors can't discern any information about this shadow. We initially speculated whether an entity existed in the area, but the probes we sent weren't gravitationally captured by any unknown presence. However, upon contact, they quickly disappeared and lost all communication signals.\n\nFinally, using some special measurement methods, we discovered that it's actually a projection from the Shroud, the shape of which is roughly the outline of a beast-eared girl magnified millions of times.\n\nBut there's a chilling detail—she seems to be observing us too."

  gts_lyxx.1.opiton: "Is that really... a giantess?"
  gts_lyxx.2.title: "A... gigantic... fox spirit!"
  gts_lyxx.2.desc: "The very next moment after we reached our conclusion, a naked fox-eared girl, resembling a maiden, appeared in space. Her sheer appearance, due to the extreme size difference, devoured a pitiful planet beneath her.\n\nImmediately afterward, our research ship's propulsion system lost power in an instant. Just as the crew despaired, thinking they would be destroyed like dust by this suddenly appearing giantess, they felt an incomparably intimate sense of comfort.\n\nOutside the porthole, gem-like, crystal-clear light purple eyes dominated most of the view."
  gts_lyxx.2.opiton.a: "Attempt to communicate with her verbally."
  gts_lyxx.2.opiton.b: "Attempt to connect with her mind."
  gts_lyxx.3.title: "A “small” joke"
  gts_lyxx.3.desc: "The atmosphere above our [from.solar_System.GetName] colony was suddenly torn open by a powerful psionic energy, creating a spatial rift. Subsequently, a white silken foot, comparable to a large metropolis, descended from the sky, gently tiptoeing on our colony.\n\n§P“Hmm... Although I said I'd help you, I heard some unpleasant voices...”§!\n\nLight purple psionic energy almost solidified into a physical form, precisely lifting some of the residents in the dust-like city beneath the girl's foot into the air.\n\n§P“Isn't that right? §MXi-chan§! doesn't like little insects who talk behind her back, you know~”§!\n\n§P“Hmm... I haven't decided how to punish you yet, how about letting you experience §MXi-chan's§! feelings firsthand?”§!\n\nThose little guys thought they were safe just now, but then their minds were flooded with a massive amount of data that even the largest superquantum computer in the empire couldn't handle.\n\n§P“Now... how fragile... I guess I'll just throw them away~”§!\n\nThose poor wretches, emptied of consciousness and turned into empty shells, didn't even leave a red spot on §MXi-chan's§! white socks.\n\nImmediately afterward, the earth trembled, and mud mixed with lava surged from the cracks. The girl's toes gently twitched, and a cluster of cities instantly turned into grime."

  gts_lyxx.999.title: "Communication Established!"
  gts_lyxx.999.desc: "Her gaze swept over these small ships in front of her, and a powerful psionic wave instantly surged through the crew's brains. She felt that the newcomers didn't seem to have any malice, so §MXi-chan§! proactively deactivated her cloaking abilities.\n\n§P“Umm... little guys... where is...?”"
  gts_lyxx.999.a: "What should we call you?"
  gts_lyxx.999.a.response: "§P“Eh... a name? Just call this fox §MXi-chan§!, okay w!”§!\n\nThe girl in front of us shook her pink and white fox ears, then gave a cute wink. §P“\n\nNow... the full name is Sakura Snow Xi, but since this fox has a pretty good impression of [from.GetName], you can use my nickname.”§!"
  gts_lyxx.999.b: "About your size."
  gts_lyxx.999.b.response: "§P“Eh now... let §MXi-chan§! think about it... umm...”§!\n\nAs an irresistible psionic signal transmitted to the entire ship, every crew member seemed to enter a hallucinatory realm based on Shroud energy.\n\nBeneath their feet was an endless pink plain, and a faint white color could be seen in the sky. The girl's hugeness gave the crew a feeling of unreality, and even a juggernaut-class battleship would have difficulty traversing the width of the girl's hair.\n\nAfter a dizzy spell, the crew's consciousness was pulled back to reality, looking at the light purple eyes that enveloped the ship's bridge.\n\n§P“Now... am I too big? §MXi-chan§! is now... about 140,000 kilometers in your units? But don't worry, §MXi-chan§! has a way to control her size!”§!"

  gts_lyxx.999.d.response: "§P“What are you referring to... §MXi-chan§! seems to know quite a lot... umm... like... some simple illusions, or some simple psionic control abilities? And...”§! *A light purple glimmer flashed through the brains of every crew member in an instant.*\n\n*The ship's signal suddenly cut off.*\n\nAfter a moment, everything inside the ship seemed as if nothing had happened, only various recorded data and video systems showed data deviations ranging from a few seconds to dozens of seconds.\n\n§P“Hmm... the little guys are still very well-behaved... but please don't have any bad thoughts about §MXi-chan§! you know.”§!"

  #Titan-Class Resurrection
  gts_lyxx.4.title: "Rebirth: Soul Traversing the Starry Sea to Remold a Psionic Avatar"
  gts_lyxx.4.desc: "Despite some unforeseen complications, the research team containing our beloved fox spirit §MXi-chan§! seems to have gotten lost in the vast sea of stars. However, after being struck by a violent warp storm, an intense psionic surge tore open a purple vortex near our imperial borders, accompanied by powerful aphrodisiac pheromones.\n\nA sweet yet slightly melancholic voice instantly transmitted across light-years through psionic means directly into our emperor's mind.\n\n§P\"Ara ara... really now, how could [owner_country.GetName] fail to take care of me~ You promised no other bugs would do anything outrageous.\"§!\n\nYour consciousness is forcibly pulled into another realm—more precisely, into the river of time recording this universe's history. A faint pink silhouette with swaying tails flickers in and out of view while your body moves uncontrollably, instinctively following this entity.\n\n§P\"Don't be scared~ Ara... found it!\"§!\n\nThe little fox pounces into an embrace. As you feel the warm, fluffy sensation, a glowing orb forces its way into your mind, revealing... the full truth behind the incident.\n\nWhen control of your body returns, the playful fox girl's ears twitch as she whispers sweetly into your ear: §P\"Now, I'll give [Root.GetHeirName]-sama one chance~ As long as...\"§!"

  #Standard Resurrection
  gts_lyxx.5.title: "§MThe Immortal Fox§!"
  gts_lyxx.5.desc: "We readily accepted this deity's conditions from another dimension, and she continues aiding our empire.\n\nMeanwhile, above the tiny colony of [from.solar_System.GetName], a lavender psionic net replaces the clouds, its tremendous suction enveloping the skies.\n\nA slender, rosy-white fingertip descends through the atmosphere, effortlessly plucking residents into the air.\n\nPsionic energy so dense it's nearly liquid—mixed with the fox spirit's pheromones—intoxicates all life on the planet. She... no, this 145km-tall casually created avatar takes great interest in our empire.\n\nStarbase observations reveal the surrounding space seemingly enveloped by violet irises... as if that entity watches us too.\n\n§P\"Ara~ Such tiny things! Pity you lack proper communication... Oh well, you'll be my first snack as this empire's little avatar~ Time to eat! Consider this your... loyal service to this puny stellar empire! Right, my little heroes?\"§!\n\nThe colonists—now §MXi-chan's§! personal consumables—are evenly sprinkled like decorative frosting across a cake's cream layer, their squirming adding texture.\n\nSevering the psionic link to [from.solar_System.GetName] seals their fate.\n\nParted lips accept the cake with psionically guided elegance.\n\nWarm, wet darkness envelops the tiny morsels, their final struggles providing unique sensations. Teeth grind cake and creatures alike into a creamy paste against her tongue.\n\n§P\"Mmm~ Delicious! Thank you, little ones!\"§!\n\nAnother frosted bite follows the first.\n\nTo the consumed, her breath carries cake's sweetness—a bliss experienced only once.\n\n...\n\n§P\"All done! Now §MXi-chan§! will keep helping [owner_country.GetName]~ Maintaining avatars is tiring though... Be nicer to me, okay?\"§!\n\nHer playful wink makes even her whimsical demands seem acceptable..."

  #Psionic Resurrection

She... no, this 145km-tall casually manifested avatar, accepts worship.\n\nOur starbase researchers projecting into the warp witness an unimaginably colossal entity—even our greatest psions can only stare dumbstruck at her dress folds, our mightiest engines mere dust mites to her gaze...\n\nOne finger extends through a spatial rift toward [from.solar_System.GetName], while another holds a scaled-down, breathtaking fox-eared maiden—§MXi-chan's§! avatar.\n\nA flick of her warp-tail severs the researchers' connection as a melodious voice echoes among our officials:\n\n§P\"Ara~ Such eager little things! Seeking my favor?\"§!\n\n§P\"Now now, I'm different from those others~ How did my previous avatar perish? Did your leader mischievously send science ships into danger? Or perhaps... triggered a stellar explosion?\"§!\n\nInstantly, all psionics under the purple haze freeze like deactivated machines.\n\n§P\"Hmph, I see! That silly cutie at the terminal really is an adorable fool! Nya~\"§!\n\nWith her coy remark, consciousness returns. Though soul-searching feels invasive, a warp deity has subtler methods—her devotees now worship more fanatically.\n\n§P\"Your wishes are known~ Let me indulge you.\"§!\n\nFloral sigils brand every psionic mind on [from.solar_System.GetName], stabilizing amplified powers through divine blessing.\n\nOther effects vary—meditating at §MXi-chan's§! toes in the warp, gentle finger pets, or projecting onto insignificant parts of her form.\n\nPink fox supremacy~ >v0!"
  gts_lyxx.6.opiton.a: "Xi-chan supremacy!"

  gts_lyxx.6.opiton.b: "Praise the fox!"
  #Temporary Non-Resurrection
  gts_lyxx.7.title: "§PPouting Little Fox§!"
  gts_lyxx.7.desc: "Knock knock—the sound manifests outside the emperor's door.\n\nA pink fox girl smiles while twitching her ears, somehow familiar yet forgotten. More upset by neglect than refusal, a psionic hand almost strikes before sisterly pressures force polite smiles.\n\n§P\"Ara... do you really hate me? Or...?\"§!\n\nTearful and petite, this harmless-looking loli bears no resemblance to a warp deity. She seeks only comfort... just a little...\n\nWere she willing, she could summon apocalyptic entities to erase [owner_country.GetName]'s millennia of history. Instead, she stands hands clasped, gazing like a chastened child.\n\n§P\"Fine then... Since you summoned me, take responsibility! At least... this avatar shall serve [owner_country.GetName], yes? You there, at the screen?\"§!\n\nShe sticks out her tongue before offering her fluffy head for pats."

  #Sock Tossing Event
  gts_lyxx.8.title: "Discarded Socks"
  gts_lyxx.8.desc: "BOOM—!\n\nThe earth trembles as skyscrapers sway. With a cheerful cry, an enormous figure appears above the city—purple-haired §MXi-chan§!, clad in elegant kimono, her glistening skin radiant under sunlight.\n\nThough appearing barely teenage, her height reaches a staggering 14km—minuscule compared to her 140,000km true form. She daintily seats herself downtown, where buildings don't reach her geta's soles. Countless structures collapse into rubble under her weight.\n\n§P\"Nya~ So hot.\"§!\n\nFanning herself, she removes footwear and socks. Bare feet glisten with sweat as steaming white tabi socks are tossed aside.\n\nCRASH!\n\nThe discarded fabric flattens entire districts like mountains, boiling steam saturating the air.\n\nNoticing fleeing citizens, §MXi-chan§! exclaims:\n\n§P\"Oh~ So many tiny dots!\"§!"

  gts_lyxx.9.title: "Discarded Socks"
  gts_lyxx.9.desc: "§MXi-chan§! blinks curiously, wiggling her toes—each motion devastating the city below. Skyscrapers crumble like sandcastles under her soles, some unfortunates embedded in her foot creases.\n\nOblivious, she waves cheerfully:\n\n§P\"Helloo~ I'm Xi-chan! You're all my toys now~ Let's play!\"§!\n\nSweat drips from her calves, flooding streets.\n\n§P\"But, um...\"§!\n\nTilting her head, fox ears droop.\n\n§P\"Did I cause too much trouble?\"§!\n\nShe surveys the ruined cityscape with faux guilt."

All better~\"§!\n\nSatisfied, she lounges while peering through a magnifier. Her ribboned hair crushes a viaduct as galaxy-sized eyes dominate the sky.\n\nCitizens scream when her lens focuses.\n\n§P\"Tehehe~ So fun!\"§!\n\nPlayful prods trigger earthquakes, toppling rebuilt structures. She giggles at the destruction:\n\n§P\"You're all so teensy~♡\"§!\n\nWhether oblivious or uncaring, her whims spell catastrophe."

  #Playtime with the Governor
  gts_lyxx.11.title: "Playtime with the Governor"
  gts_lyxx.11.desc: "§MXi-chan§! sits cross-legged on the apartment's wooden floor, cheeks propped in her hands. It's a rare day off, and she intends to relax properly. The petite girl rummages through her oversized kimono sleeve, producing an even tinier figure—the planet's governor himself.\n\n§P\"Hehe~ Governor-sama, you'll have to endure today~\"§!\n\nWith a mischievous wink, she stands, her white stockinged feet padding across the floor. The translucent fabric reveals glimpses of pink toes as she looms over the miniature official. Before he can protest, her fingers open—\n\nPLOP.\n\nThe governor lands face-first on the floor, only to be immediately pinned beneath her stockinged sole. The silken fabric molds to his torso, leaving only his head exposed, gasping helplessly. §MXi-chan§! giggles, prodding his squirming form with a fingertip.\n\n§P\"So pathetic~ Like a trembling little mouse!\"§!\n\nHer right foot presses down, toes kneading his chest. The stocking grows damp with sweat, clinging tighter as she grinds him into the floorboards. A sickening CRACK echoes as ribs splinter—crimson blooms across pristine white fabric.\n\n§P\"Eww~ Governor-sama's blood is so dirty~♡\"§!\n\nShe peels off the soiled sock, revealing a rosy foot now streaked with gore. With renewed vigor, she stomps—his face disappears beneath her sole, nostrils flooded with the cloying scent of adolescent sweat and iron. Consciousness flickers as bones pulverize into paste...\n\nWhen she finally lifts her foot, only a red smear remains.\n\n§P\"Ara ara... completely broken~\"§!\n\nHumming cheerfully, §MXi-chan§! skips through the gore, leaving bloody footprints toward her study."

Had it all been a dream?\n\nKNOCK KNOCK.\n\n§P\"Governor-sama, may I come in?\"§!\n\n§MXi-chan§! enters, demure in lavender kimono. She beams up at him, barely reaching his chest.\n\n§P\"Data collection complete! Thanks for cooperating~♡\"§!\n\nBefore he reacts, she plants a kiss on his cheek—and stuffs something into his palm. The bloodstained socks from yesterday.\n\n§P\"A souvenir! Treasure them~\"§!\n\nHer innocent smile doesn't mask the mischief in her eyes as she skips away, calling over her shoulder:\n\n§P\"Next experiment soon—be ready!\"§!"

She shrinks him further—to one centimeter—and drops him down her collar. §P\"...enjoy the view properly!\"§!\n\nSoft flesh engulfs him. Each breath presses him deeper into warm, pillowy cleavage. Her giggles vibrate through him as a fingertip prods his trapped form.\n\n§P\"Getting excited? How lewd~\"§!\n\nJust as he nears climax, she flicks him onto the desk—only to bind him in her silken hair. The governor struggles helplessly as she exposes more skin, pink nipples pebbling in the cool air.\n\n§P\"Should I crush you against my chest?\"§! She licks her lips. §P\"Or keep you as a pet?\"§!\n\nThe door BANGS open—a clerk freezes at the scandalous scene before fleeing. §MXi-chan§! yelps, vanishing in a puff of smoke.
