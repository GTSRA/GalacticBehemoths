 # Original: 我们释放$gts_giantess_fluid$信息素后，狂风很快就平息了。\n\n一阵温和的气流轻拂过大地，释放出一捆捆毛茸茸的气生生殖结构。这些生殖结构包裹着遗传物质飘向地面，然而大部分很快都被$trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$形成的薄毯分解。\n\n存活下来的少量生殖结构附着在光秃秃的地形上，形成一个个圆锥形的水螅体，为$gts_wind_creatures$的安全成熟提供了一个稳固且受保护的环境。\n\n显然，$trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$阻止着$gts_wind_creatures$的繁殖。\n\n我们的结论是，风展示了真菌是如何试图阻止它们的繁殖过程的。
 gts_astral_rift.2750.desc.common:0 "After we released the $gts_giantess_fluid$ pheromone, the fierce wind quickly subsided.\n\nA gentle current brushed across the land, releasing bundles of furry aerial reproductive structures. These reproductive structures wrapped in genetic material floated toward the ground, but most were quickly decomposed by the thin blanket formed by $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$.\n\nA small number of surviving reproductive structures attached themselves to the bare terrain, forming cone-shaped polyps, providing a stable and protected environment for the safe maturation of $gts_wind_creatures$.\n\nClearly, $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ is preventing the reproduction of $gts_wind_creatures$.\n\nOur conclusion is that the wind demonstrated how the fungi attempt to stop their reproductive process."

 gts_astral_rift.2755.desc:0 "We provided large amounts of $gts_giantess_fluid$ and alloy scrap to the $gts_wind_creatures$.

The violent wind began to attack the foot grime rifts, targeting the spore-spewing $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ in a coordinated decapitation bombardment.\n\nPerhaps as a token of gratitude, a breeze sent us a bundle of furry \"floating eggs\". With these, we can cultivate our own \"$gts_wind_creatures$\" and bring this airflow, highly adapted to the environment under a Giantess's foot and the use of $gts_giantess_fluid$, to some of our selected colonies."

 gts_astral_rift.2760.desc:0 "We spread a large amount of $gts_giantess_fluid$ on the planet's surface as nutrients and introduced new wind-resistant plants in the richer foot grime mountains. Then, $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ was able to spread valid spores on the foot grime soil weathered by plants.\n\nThe existing $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ colonies are growing in scale and resilience. Over time, $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ will spread along the entire surface of the insole, removing the foundation for the reproduction of $gts_wind_creatures$—undoubtedly, the true source of the wind, the Giantess's slight foot movements, are too violent for the reproductive process of these fierce winds.\n\nThe nodes of $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ are filled with newfound power, and messages of gratitude are being transmitted along its mycelial network.\n\nA previously undiscovered specimen of $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ subsequently sprouted from the foot grime near us.

 gts_astral_rift.2765.desc:0 "The extreme difference in form between $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ and $gts_wind_creatures$ led to an arduous and complex discussion. However, we finally reached an agreement between the two species.\n\nAs long as they do not interfere with existing spore colonies, $gts_wind_creatures$ will have the right to hunt and reproduce in designated areas on the planet's surface. At the same time, the hive mind of $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ was granted equal space where they can spread spores without fear and accommodate countless other species under their protective network.\n\nUnder this arrangement, this unique ecosystem belonging to the foot of a Giantess has a new opportunity to flourish. We have established an observation post to monitor its progress from outside the rift."

 # Original: 我们来到了一个被猛烈的狂风摧残着的无垠平原。它的表面完全是是荒芜的，绝大部分高于地表的地形已经被风化得很光滑，而地面则是纵横规律排列的弧形山脊与深不见底的黝黑山谷。\n\n目之所及，遍布的不规则岩块与地面的颜色并不完全一致，前者黄褐，后者灰白。当我们对这些岩石进行采样时，发现其表面松软而内部致密，但松散表层的成因并不像是风化，而是极高的含水量？\n\n上方乌云密布，天空一片漆黑，只有些许微光从厚厚的云层后漫射至此。当又一阵呼啸的狂风自平原上空席卷而下，涌入山谷的时候，遥远的云团之间有一些明亮的气团猛烈地喷发出来。\n\n环境传感器显示，此处的空气湿度与温度都正随着疾风骤然升高，我们应该尽快寻找避风的地方躲避即将来临的暴风雨。而根据气象传感器的结果，平流层高度的气流比较温和，我们可以在那里躲避危险的下击暴流。或者，地形扫描也提供了附近山谷中的一个大洞穴作为避难所。
 gts_astral_rift.2700.desc:0 "We arrived at a vast plain ravaged by violent winds. Its surface is completely barren; most of the terrain above ground level has been weathered smooth, while the ground consists of regular, crisscrossing arc-shaped ridges and bottomless dark valleys.\n\nAs far as the eye can see, the scattered irregular rock masses do not match the color of the ground; the former are yellow-brown, while the latter are grayish-white. When we sampled these rocks, we found their surface soft but their interior dense. The formation of the loose surface layer does not seem to be due to weathering, but rather extremely high water content?\n\nDark clouds gather above, and the sky is pitch black, with only a little faint light diffusing from behind the thick clouds. As another gust of howling wind sweeps down from above the plain and pours into the valley, bright air masses erupt violently between the distant clouds.\n\nEnvironmental sensors show that the humidity and temperature of the air here are rising sharply with the gale. We should find a sheltered place to hide from the approaching storm as soon as possible. According to the meteorological sensor results, the airflow at stratospheric altitudes is milder, and we can take shelter there from the dangerous microbursts. Alternatively, topographical scans also provided a large cave in a nearby valley as a shelter."

 gts_astral_rift.2705.desc:0 "Breaking through the churning clouds, we saw a sky even blacker than the misty ground below. The sky is a boundless curtain with a more regular and fine vertical and horizontal arrangement than the ground—undoubtedly, it is a giant net!\n\nEven more incredible is that this giant net is regularly expanding and contracting on an immeasurable scale. As we continued to try to get closer, we realized that behind this net was a giant wall, whose vertical movement was even more exaggerated.\n\nWind constantly swept past our hull, and as we approached the range of the giant wall's undulations, every gust became more violent.\n\nThe strong signal from the biological sensors confirmed our conjecture—§YWe are on the sole of a Giantess!§!\n\nEven more wonderful is that another weak biological signal around us seems to change regularly with the airflow in the wind. These airflows are not just a special weather pattern; their behavior is also unusually precise. More importantly, we discovered a hormone-like compound in the swirling air. Subsequent analysis showed that this is surprisingly similar to the biological reaction of plants when attacked."

 # Original: 我们回到了平原之上，现在应当称作巨娘鞋垫之上了。其上漂浮的那层厚厚的云雾，显然是这位巨娘蒸腾的足汗。尽管鞋垫几乎一马平川，也不适宜绝大部分生物生活，但巨娘足下丰富的足垢资源仍然为生命$trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$提供了充分的生存资源，在每一个富集足垢的棉网裂谷和缝隙中都栖息着一些散发着孢子的真菌簇。\n\n运送我们至此的气流轻拂过大地，释放出一捆捆毛茸茸的气生生殖结构。这些生殖结构包裹着遗传物质飘向地面，然而大部分很快都被$trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$形成的薄毯分解。\n\n存活下来的少量生殖结构附着在光秃秃的地形上，形成一个个圆锥形的水螅体，为$gts_wind_creatures$的安全成熟提供了一个稳固且受保护的环境。\n\n显然，$trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$阻止着$gts_wind_creatures$的繁殖。反过来，$gts_wind_creatures$不断掠袭着鞋垫平原表面，迫使$trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$撤退到最隐蔽的足垢深谷中。
 gts_astral_rift.2725.desc:0 "We returned to the plain, which should now be called the surface of the Giantess's insole.

Although the insole is almost flat and unsuitable for most creatures to live on, the abundant foot grime resources under the Giantess's foot still provide ample survival resources for life $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$. In every cotton web rift and crevice rich in foot grime, there live some spore-emitting fungal clusters.\n\nThe airflow that transported us here brushed gently across the land, releasing bundles of furry aerial reproductive structures. These reproductive structures wrapped in genetic material floated toward the ground, but most were quickly decomposed by the thin blanket formed by $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$.\n\nA small number of surviving reproductive structures attached themselves to the bare terrain, forming cone-shaped polyps, providing a stable and protected environment for the safe maturation of $gts_wind_creatures$.\n\nClearly, $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ is preventing the reproduction of $gts_wind_creatures$. Conversely, $gts_wind_creatures$ constantly raid the surface of the insole plain, forcing $trait_gts_under_feet_fungus$ to retreat into the most hidden deep valleys of foot grime."
