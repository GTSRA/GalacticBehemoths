  WAR_GREETING_H_TO_GTS_02: "Hahaha, where did these buzzing bugs come from? Seeking [From.Capital.GetName] to be used personally by our [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]?"
  WAR_GREETING_GTS_TO_H_01: "You guys only serve to make food expensive, now, please surrender and serve your final purpose!"

  WAR_GREETING_GTS_TO_H_02: "Your stiff bodies and unsatisfied hearts under our fleet are ironic. We should’ve canned you from the start."
  WAR_DECLEAR_GTS_TO_H: "Prepare to transform your cunts cleanly into e-stim generators!"
  WAR_DECLEAR_H_TO_GTS: "You dust specks without meaning, embrace your destiny as dust-disappear into the cosmos!"

  PEACE_PROPOSE_H_TO_GTS: "[Root.GetSpeciesName], your energy exceeds our expectations, so here are some favorable terms for you."
  PEACE_PROPOSE_GTS_TO_H: "[Root.GetSpeciesName], you are quite difficult to deal with, how about we each take a step back and end the struggle with these terms?"
  PEACE_ACCEPT_H_TO_GTS: "Alright, little bug, this farce is over."
  PEACE_ACCEPT_GTS_TO_H: "Ceasefire agreement reached, initiate withdrawal procedure."
  PEACE_REFUSE_H_TO_GTS: "This laughable agreement is as fit to be crushed underfoot as you are."

  MAKE_RIVAL_PROPOSE_GTS_TO_H: "Your existence severely impacts our interests, [Root.GetName]."
  MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY_H_TO_GTS: "As expected, [Root.GetSpeciesName] is shameless like a bug."

  MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY_GTS_TO_H: "A waste of such big brain and heart-what use are these organs for manners?"
  END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY_H_TO_GTS: "In the end, you still crawl back, little bug."
  END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY_GTS_TO_H: "Finally willing to bow down your oversized head?"
  END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL_H_TO_GTS: "After tormenting our people, you want peace now?"
  END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL_GTS_TO_H: "After treating our people as toys, you want peace now?"
  END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE_H_TO_GTS: "Ridiculous, no peace until compensated for our partner’s abuse!"
  END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE_GTS_TO_H: "Such a cunning plan, but your cowardly requests pale, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
  END_RIVALRY_ANGRY_H_TO_GTS: "Beg for mercy, damned bug, maybe we’ll spare you."

  END_RIVALRY_PROPOSE_GTS_TO_H: "We agree to cease hostilities temporarily."
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY_H_TO_GTS: "We can coexist... as long as you don’t repeat mistakes."
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY_GTS_TO_H: "Let’s resume our mutually beneficial exchange."
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL_H_TO_GTS: "So be it."
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL_GTS_TO_H: "Acceptable for now."
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE_H_TO_GTS: "Watching you beg is delightful, but we’ll still eliminate you next time."
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE_GTS_TO_H: "Spread your legs and surrender, [From.GetName]"
  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_ANGRY_H_TO_GTS: "Forced to associate with you is truly an insult..."

  END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_ANGRY_GTS_TO_H: "Die, you vile creatures!"
  INSULT_NEUTRAL_H_TO_GTS: "What? A special message? Did it come from another 'mouth'?"
  INSULT_NEUTRAL_GTS_TO_H: "Think about our differences before speaking, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
  INSULT_FRIENDLY_H_TO_GTS: "We... can still cooperate, right?"
  INSULT_FRIENDLY_GTS_TO_H: "We are already intimately connected, is there still something lacking?"
  INSULT_HOSTILE_H_TO_GTS: "Better explain before we crush your pitiful planet."
  INSULT_HOSTILE_GTS_TO_H: "Don’t challenge us, or the tormentor will show you what inescapable torment means."
