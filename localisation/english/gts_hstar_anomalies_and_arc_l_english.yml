  site_gts_hstar_D_desc: "The coordinates that relay the information point to this planet, which once housed some advanced facility-though now in ruins. Yet, the sudden signals emanating from here suggest there are still significant secrets to uncover: our origins, our characteristics, our construction-so many answers await our discovery."

  gts_hstar_anomaly.1.desc: "Our reverse tracing has finally yielded results. Here, on this mysterious planet, a gigantic research facility, clearly abandoned due to damage, stands next to a mechanical planet designed as a computer, evidence of a remnant advanced civilization. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] suggests further exploration to gather more-perhaps possible clues about our origins. Could it be that our innate desire for gigantism, entwined with the biological instincts towards the opposite sex, was intentionally embedded in our genes?"

  gts_hstar_arc_sites_event.1.name: "A Fortuitous Discovery"

  gts_hstar_arc_sites_event.1.desc: "We deciphered a portion of the data stored here, which seems to be a journal of a researcher. However, its content is a bit astounding.\n\n §YUnified Year March 1, 2020\nFor some reason, I can feel that a red bacterium I cultured is displaying emotions, especially under the microscope. The moment the fungi beside them engulf the red bacteria, I experience a wave of mixed feelings such as reluctance, anger, despair, and other unknown emotions, resonating within me. But... it must be my illusion. §!\n\n§BArgh-damned fungi on my feet are so itchy-they're back again-damn it, it's so itchy-§! §YUnified Year March 2, 2020\n\nAhhhh-I forgot to put the petri dish back last night! If the director finds out, they'll definitely scold me!\nBut... how have the white fungal colonies turned into a dark red, coarse colony? Was it contaminated? Or... I think I should take a look.\n\n\nThe image under the microscope astonishes me. The red bacteria that should've vanished have re-emerged, consuming the original fungal colonies and exhibiting peculiar mutations: under high magnification, a scythe-like sharp mutated flagellum is slicing through the surrounding fungus, slaughtering them as if cutting fruit. This is far beyond what ordinary red bacteria can do.\n\nSuch a discovery is simply too important: whether by chance or fortune, this new predatory form holds immense research and utilization value. As the observation continues, it can be seen that these bacterial communities spontaneously gather and show tendencies to merge, much like sardines forming new collectives, spontaneously beginning to cooperate and divide labor. One part of the bacteria mainly attacks the fungus on the periphery, while another part absorbs nutrients and fungal content internally, synthesizing new substances to sustain themselves and other bacteria at the front. In just one night, these bacteria show trends of evolving into multicellular organisms!\nThe resilience of these red bacteria is simply astonishing; no matter how formidable the rival fungi are, as long as one survives, the colony can be doomed. Furthermore, when competing for nutrients with other colonies, the red bacteria initially seem at a disadvantage, but in the next moment evolve weapons to counter their enemies.\n\nThey are constantly adapting to the environment! And they think! It's unbelievable; these microorganisms actually have the idea of tactical thinking, and they learn from failures to evolve corresponding coping mechanisms almost instantaneously in their perceived time. More surprisingly, it seems they communicate! Whenever a compatriot is surrounded, they immediately come to aid their kind. §! §BMy mind feels overly excited, as if I'm watching a war movie. Could bacteria like these truly evolve to such a level.......? This is simply a breakthrough! These damned fungi were eradicated so quickly. Soon, I won't have to endure them! §!"

  gts_hstar_arc_sites_event.2.desc: "Next, a lengthy recording was decrypted, which, after analysis by scientists, is considered very valuable:\n\n§BDamn it-why are there ants in my chocolate cake! Damned pests-\n\nHmph~! Dare to eat my cake, let's see how I torment you!§!\nFollowing was a continuous rustling sound, presumably the friction of limbs against other materials. It sounded like some repetitive action was being carried out at varying distances.\n§BSo small.... In their eyes, I must appear to be a terrifying giant..... Tiny creatures almost invisible on the floor, perhaps my step nearby feels like an earthquake to them. As for those I've eaten, maybe they are struggling in my stomach...... Compared to them, I'm simply gigantic! Hehehe, hahahahah!§!\nSudden manic laughter pierces the recording, settling down after tens of seconds. Yet, a faint excitement lingers in the following moments.\n§BThe feeling of holding tiny life at my fingertips is truly incredible! With a gentle squeeze, these little ants...§!\nFollowed by a slight squishing sound.\n§BBecome insignificant dust at my fingertips...... Whenever I want, I can end their tiny lives..... Like looking down from a high tower..... Whew--§!\nAfter a deep breath, the recording paused for a few seconds before continuing.\n§BI wish I were a giantess..... Imagine, holding a whole city at my fingertips, just lightly pinching-what would the people think? Despair? Defiance? Then watching my fingers close in like a sky falling.... Humph humph... A mere dust-like city would crumble..... Ah, just imagining it makes me a bit damp...... §!\n\nIt turns out the subject does have tendencies of colossal creatures, yet we still can't determine their size relative to us. Is it a giantess's monologue or the fantasy of an ordinary-sized individual? We need more data...\n\n§BHaha~~ Big sis thought up an interesting game~§!\nFollowing, a series of increasingly distant, rhythmic heavy sounds assault our eardrums, then suddenly a 'thump' - a weighted object seems to have landed on the ground with a small surface area, followed by a slight rustling and the returning of heavy sounds, accompanied by increasingly heavy female breaths as the recording resumed.\n§BDon't be shy~ Come inside~❤§!\nA distinctly coquettish voice emerges from the recording, speaking as if to a tiny group, followed by two tapping sounds.\n§BThere is the most intense smell~~~ Since they've worn all day, there's a bit of sweat, the scent is certainly strong~ You must clean well~~~§!\n\n§BOh, struggling little ants~ If they were tinies, what expressions would they have~~ But so small, if they were really tiny, such size wouldn't show your expressions. Yet, this size difference is so captivating~~~§!\nThen another different rustling briefly sounded.\n§BBe careful~ The goddess’s foot is coming in! But, if there were a city inside the shoe, what a sight it would be~ Hahaha~§!\nA slow rubbing and crushing noise gently transmitted, suggesting the subject was undertaking some destructive trampling.\n§BAh~ ah~~❤ I can feel it, I can feel it~❤ They're struggling in my shoe! It's so itchy~~! So thrilling~~~!§!\nThe exhilarating high tones even resonated, accompanied by what seemed like high heels tapping on a tile floor. Everything explained: the subject placed multiple small creatures inside their high heel, currently trampling them.\n§BLittle guys, still crawling over my toes..... Such a weak yet intricate feeling. Climb harder, climb~! Or I'll wiggle my toes and crush you~~ Such a tickling sensation, what if those microscopic city's artillery fire hit my foot-it must feel great, surely resisting with all their might against my toes, perhaps not even needing a toe wiggle, the aroma alone could win. Trying desperately to escape the world, just my small shoe, just a small toe...... Ah, can't help, crawling around, want to rub my toes hard, but reluctant, yet..... So itchy! So sorry~§!\nIntense rubbing accompanied by the faint sound of squishing a group of small creatures lightly emerged, indicating those small lives were all wiped out.\n§BReally thrilling, being dominated by small beings ten times smaller, it's wonderful! Obviously, the stronger side, yet bullied by such weak entities. This contradiction.... truly enjoyable-Well... sometimes want to be a giantess ruling over tinies, sometimes want to be restricted to be ruled by tinies...... Such a contradictory self~ But, got a bit carried away this time. §!\nSeveral taps sounded, likely the subject shaking out what's inside the high heel.\n§BOrdering takeout then, file the information onto a USB later... Oh no, again!§!\nA new, much stronger and denser rubbing sound occurred.\n§BThese fungi on the skin are so annoying.... Itchy.... Wait! Why not try those red bacteria? Draw a little, smear it on the foot, with those creatures' capability it should work..... Just a little..... Eh? When was the recorder turned on--§!"

  gts_hstar_arc_sites_event.3.desc: "§YUnified Year March 3, 2020\nIn order to observe the activities of these red bacteria better, I placed the petri dish under a more advanced electron microscope. A greater magnification revealed even more astonishing findings:\nIn just one night, these bacteria started evolving into three distinct multicellular forms, one with serrated blades covering its body and a ferocious maw filled with sharp teeth; one simple in structure, characterized by basic congregated cells but with surprisingly fast nutrient absorption; and the third... to be honest, though only emerging from among trillions of bacteria, even a cold sweat couldn't help trickling down my face: these extremely rare individuals differed from others, having a more human-like body structure colored in a deep blue hue. Not only that, during the following 5 hours of observations, I was shocked to see these deep blue variants not only had humanlike facial expressions and muscle structures but even language and thought! This is simply incredible! More shockingly, a portion of unswallowed cocci seemed raised like livestock, feeding on the red bacteria's surpluses, and forcibly splitting out more individuals for the red bacteria's consumption! Isn't this the human way of taming beasts and raising livestock?!!\nIn other words, these bacteria not only defeated all the enemy colonies here with rapid reproductive mutation but considered limited resources in the petri dish, retaining some cocci turned into living production tools. From the blood-red spined bacteria for battle to the nutrient-absorbing worker bacteria, and finally to these deep blue individuals seemingly the geniuses or leaders within the community.\nUnder an ultra-high magnification microscope, you could even see their facial expressions change! These unknown bacterial life forms evolved basic societal branches, division of labor, and perhaps developed societal thought alongside potentially high-level intelligence within a single night!§!\n§BFrankly, I'm dumbfounded, not sure if it's my illusion, I seemed to notice one deep blue bacterium 'looked' at me... Such a completely illogical organism, to what extent can it evolve?§!\n§YAll newly joined bacteria without exception were devoured completely, even the most lethal toxins were countered and assimilated by the red bacteria evolving corresponding mechanisms later in the conflict. §!\n§BIf we could capitalize on this trait, it could solve numerous stubborn diseases plaguing this planet for years...§!\n§PWhat are you looking at, D-sis? So absorbed?§!\nA new voice appeared, presumed to be another female researcher.\n§BWhat, it's you. Can't even greet properly when entering....§!\n§PHaha, sorry~ Saw D-sis so entranced, so watched for a bit~§!\n§BYou sure have time to spare.... Again with the D-sis.... because my name's first letter is D....§!\n§PHeehee~~ But sis, your figure's amazing~ Frankly, your 'D' label doesn’t fit your size, should be called ‘G’ sis...§!\n§BAlright! Shoo, don't disturb my work. §!\n§PSigh, D-sis~ I envy your body and face... you could make it big as a model or movie star! Why stay here as a lowly researcher with low pay...§!\n§BI'm fine with it.... always interested since middle school. §!\n§POkay, beautiful. So what’re you studying? Whatever’s making the campus belle mesmerized.... Such small bacteria, what's so fascinating..... Ewww!!! Disgusting! Good thing I took physics, these invisible microbes moving upon magnification give me chills......§!\n§BOh, Jing, maybe they harbor potential beyond our imagination, like evolving into.....§!\n§PAh, forget it, D-sis. Bet I wouldn't understand if you explained, so let's leave it... mere lowly microbes, nothing magical... can't imagine them flying planes or watching TV? Okay, I won't bother you, D-sis, got stuff to do.

Progress, reproduction, expansion, attack... then another application sound.\n§BAh.....~~~~ So comfortable~ Mmm-mmm~~§!\nThe murmured hums of comfort and the friction between certain skin parts all affirm that Miss D-given she already has this moniker, why not use it-is in a pleasant, refreshing state. §BThose red bacteria.... do they truly have thoughts? If they had thoughts, what scene might they perceive? I'm afraid even a single wrinkle of mine could accommodate tens of thousands of their cities, if they could develop to such scale... My toes, soles, even a drop of my foot sweat must be utterly monumental to them?\nPerhaps even an unconscious toe twitch could feel like an earthquake to them; a drop of sweat falls, and perhaps a city is vanished...\nSo, to them, would I appear as a deity? Surely not even in the same dimension, if they were living between my toes, sustaining themselves through generation on my foot sweat and toe dirt while enduring the smell of my stinky feet every day...\nWhat... what am I thinking~! But, if those red bacteria truly had human-like intelligence, then at this very moment, aren't there millions of microscopic tinies waging an intense war against those foot fungi between my toes?! Conducting warfare within my toes... Oh my! What in the world am I thinking!! (*/ω＼*) Ridiculous! But..... but...... can't restrain myself...... §!\nFabric is drawn open, as moist skin begins to rub against each other, accompanied by soft moans, Miss D resumes her soliloquy.\n§BI wish to grow, grow gigantically immense, then a step forward would crush a city..... leading to shameful play with tinies..... because.... because you all are just too tiny!§!\nTiny ants.... now practically invisible bacteria are on my toes, such a distinct sensation, how many tinies must be striving to please me? Ten thousand? A million? A billion? Yet no matter how numerous, I can't see them, because they're just too small! Too tiny! Far too small!!!§!\nThe rustle and rubbing pleasure accelerates as if gradually aroused.\n§BOh~❤ Oh~❤§!\nFriction and stroking noises accompany coquettish breaths, intensifying steadily. Unsurprisingly, at this moment, Miss D is evidently consumed by sexual impulse, engaging in self-pleasure.\n§BThe frequency of D's self-pleasure quickens, on the brink of climax, she can no longer regulate her breaths, gasping at a pace like a steam locomotive.\n§BOh~❤ It's too itchy! Harder...!§!\nA bumping noise, followed by the intense rubbing sound, united with the depths of her emotions, reaches a peak!\n§BOh~ can't... can't hold it.... Ah!!!!§!\nLove juices gush forth, wildly spilling onto the white sheets, nearly a drop away from falling on her feet.\n§BOh.... Ha....

The footage seems to be a meeting, and through prior analysis, we quickly identified Miss D. Unlike the surrounding white coats, Miss D's outfit of a blazer + vest + high-waisted jean shorts perfectly showcased her model-like figure, making her stand out in a room mostly filled with men. Throughout the meeting, several men’s glances were involuntarily drawn to Miss D's allure. Her enticing black stockings paired with sexy heels were a devastating weapon. The 10cm shoe heels added to Miss D's height, magnifying her presence to appear like a goddess, driving men mad and inspiring women.\nYet, these sexy heel-clad feet appeared restless, sometimes swaying back and forth, shoes tiptoeing, and scraping as if something was provocatively disturbing her.\n§BOh..... it's so itchy, is the quantity this substantial already?§!\nMiss D's face turned slightly red, brows slightly knitted as her toes strained back and forth inside her heels as if trodden by a thousand ants, producing tingling itchiness, making it impossible for her to focus on the meeting.\n§BAs insignificant as they are, they can make me feel.....§!\n§BIt's getting itchier.....§!\nThe elegant script on her notes nearly spelled 'itchy,' evidently, Miss D felt the itch between her toes growing intensely, yet in this setting, removing her shoes to ease her itch was out of the question, let alone...\n§BMoreover, bacteria-sized creatures building a civilization on my toes pierces my G-spot!§!\nThe high heels under the table kept changing position, clearly striving to resist the itch. However, this scene prompted the men diagonally behind to find excuses to visit the restroom.\nHmph, lechers.\n§MComrade Vera, are you listening?§!\nThe middle-aged woman giving the presentation saw Miss D at odds and, quite displeased, called out Miss D by her real name in front of everyone. §BOh, I'm listening, listening......§!\nSeemingly slapped with sudden shock, Miss D's body trembled slightly upon hearing her name, promptly agreeing while twisting her hips and pressing down on her foot.\n§MNow, it's your turn, discuss the progress on the project you were responsible for last month. §!\nThe middle-aged woman glanced at Miss D, then relinquished the 'center stage' for Miss D to step up.\n§BOkay... sure.....§!\nMiss D took the documents on the table, prepared for a month, yet a subtle sound was nevertheless recorded.\n§BOh..... can you stop moving, it's so itchy.....§!\nMiss D pursed her lips in an attempt to endure the discomfort from the soles-appearing both itchy and painful-struggling to stand from her seat while striving not to draw attention to the peculiarities inside her shoes. The fine black heels tapped lightly on the marble floor, producing gentle 'da-da' sounds.\n§BOh dear..... that spot between my toes is acting up again......§!\nMiss D walked to the lectern, prepared to begin her presentation. Then the itch between her big toe and second toe heightened, finally forcing her, or subconsciously, to rub her toes strongly."

Haha~ Never expected a goddess like Miss D has such issues?§!\nHearing this, Old Li indulged more in his fantasy. Hearing Old Zhang say this, Old Li noticed that beneath Miss D's usually icy beauty, her lips were pressed tight, occasionally glancing downward, with a seldom seen pained expression.\n§LWho would have thought...... Such a goddess like Miss D, with matchless beauty, a perfect hourglass figure, and formidable personal skills, admired by all, like an unattainable sun.\nYet this tall, mighty, and domineering career woman can feel a twinge of discomfort from bacteria unseen to the naked eye a million times smaller. Old Li even envied those bacteria, living inside the goddess’s shoe, causing her to endure the mild itch they prompted. To be so close to the goddess’s delicate feet, to survive beneath her toe wrinkles, feasting on sweat, dwelling in grime until swept away by a drop of diminutive sweat, absorbed into the shoe fibers with the sweat, eventually crushed by an unconscious motion....... It’s sublime! I wish to transform into a grain of sand, fall into her shoe, trodden, crushed, yet freely defile these sacred, gigantic feet. Let her endure the differences within her shoe, her tender skin itching and aching from the sand grains until she finally shakes me out, ultimately mingling with dust and disappearing from this world......§!\nOld Li’s gaze fixated on the distant high heel under the table, trembling unconsciously as his imagination wandered.\n§LInside a goddess's shoe, it must be heaven.......§!\n\n§MComrade Vera, please stop moving, focus on your presentation. §!\nThe middle-aged woman below watched Miss D on the podium, feet persistently shifting, and noticed the captivated researchers around, wrinkling her brow in reprimand.\n§BYes, Director.....§! Miss D nodded apologetically, continuing her presentation of the second part of the ppt.
