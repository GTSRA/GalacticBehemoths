  # Acquired during the Eyjafjalla Situation
  EYJAFJALLA_PROJECT: "Acquire from Eyjafjalla's Foot"
  eyjafjalla_hair: "Golden Fleece"
  eyjafjalla_hair_desc_short: "A single hair from Eyjafjalla"
  eyjafjalla_hair_desc_details: "Shimmers golden in the sunlight.  Under Eyjafjalla's devastatingly huge feet, all the engineering marvels of the small people are less durable than a single strand of her hair."
  landcarrier_wreck: "Landcarrier Wreckage"
  landcarrier_wreck_desc_short: "A crude vehicle, simply pieced together from iron plates with extremely simplified functions, bearing a chessboard symbol."
  landcarrier_wreck_desc_details: "We thought it was some kind of model, but unexpectedly found traces of intelligent life activity on board. Decrypting the ship's recorder reveals that this vessel was mistakenly generated during a 'City District Management Exercise' and was caught in Eyjafjalla's foot during post-exercise disposal. It seems the ship wandered in the valleys of her foot for a considerable time until it was completely destroyed."
  startower_wreck: "Startower Wreckage"
  startower_wreck_desc_short: "A building several hundred meters tall... now several hundred meters long, its spire seemingly shattered by compression."
  startower_wreck_desc_details: "For the industrial-age natives who built it, this was their grand attempt to challenge nature, but for Eyjafjalla, who generated them for 'City Management,' it was just one of many preset destruction points."
  eyjafjalla_silt: "Eyja Swamp Silt"
  eyjafjalla_silt_desc_short: "Silt collected from the swamp in Eyjafjalla's arch."
  eyjafjalla_silt_desc_details: "Through dating analysis, we can roughly analyze the impact of the giantess's diet, sleep, and mood on her endocrine system.  The remaining samples have been collected and commemorated in the Eyjafjalla Museum."
  eyjafjalla_water: "Eyja River Water Sample"
  eyjafjalla_water_desc_short: "Water sample collected from the river in Eyjafjalla's sole."
  eyjafjalla_water_desc_details: "Rich in various minerals and microorganisms.  If her foot sweat were luckily preserved on a barren planet, starting from the first life beneath it, Eyjafjalla might create a new civilization with her foot."
  eyjafjalla_vaccine: "Eyja Woodland Fungus Vaccine"
  eyjafjalla_vaccine_desc_short: "Fungal strain collected from a hidden valley on Eyjafjalla's foot."
  eyjafjalla_vaccine_desc_details: "Under the combined influence of space radiation and the giantess's power, this fungus reproduces easily. After processing, it not only retains the fragrance of Eyjafjalla's jade foot but is also eight times more nutritious than ant beef."
  siesta_flagstone: "Siesta Flagstone"
  siesta_flagstone_desc_short: "Record tablet from an ancient civilization."
  siesta_flagstone_desc_details: "Records how their prosperous city-state civilization was destroyed by a humanoid natural disaster in a swimsuit who landed on the coast, used her twin volcanoes to spew scorching lava to flood the city, and finally used her ample buttocks to completely crush the city ruins. However, there are many questionable points about this tablet, and its authenticity is not reliable. Some believe that it may just be a baseless, exaggerated interpretation of a historical volcanic eruption that destroyed the city by a descendant of this civilization."
  eyjafjalla_diamond: "Eyjafjalla Diamond"
  eyjafjalla_diamond_desc_short: "Diamond instantly formed when planets, shaped by the universe over billions of years, were compressed between Eyjafjalla's two toes."
  eyjafjalla_diamond_desc_details: "Aside from the surface mucus and dust, within this diamond created by Eyjafjalla herself, psionic energy of explosive proportions hums."
  foottip_keratin: "Foot Tip Keratin"
  foottip_keratin_desc_short: "Keratin scraped from the inside of Eyjafjalla's big toenail."
  foottip_keratin_desc_details: "The expedition members managed to collect only a few fragments. By imitating its material, molecular distribution, and even the contained psionic energy, it can be used to strengthen our military defenses."
  eyjafjalla_footmap1: "Rough Map of Eyjafjalla's Foot"
  eyjafjalla_footmap1_desc_short: "A map created based on previous medical scans and the current exploration team's findings, providing a rough overview of the terrain of Eyjafjalla's foot."
  eyjafjalla_footmap1_desc_details: "Includes dozens of hours of recorded explorer interviews and foot survival experience sharing."
  eyjafjalla_footmap2: "Detailed Map of Eyjafjalla's Foot"
  eyjafjalla_footmap2_desc_short: "A map combining medical scans and the exploration team's findings, detailing the ecological environment and geographical features of Eyjafjalla's foot."
  eyjafjalla_footmap2_desc_details: "Includes hundreds of hours of recorded exploration experiences and foot survival tips."
  eyjafjalla_footmap3: "Precise Map of Eyjafjalla's Foot"
  eyjafjalla_footmap3_desc_short: "A redraw map based on several expeditions, providing detailed and precise information on the ecology, geography, and resources of Eyjafjalla's foot. Several resource areas and habitable locations are marked."
