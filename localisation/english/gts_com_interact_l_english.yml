  gts_leader_interact.100.desc: "As the number of giantess leaders recruited by our empire increases, along with the continuous expansion of our territories, some related problems have emerged:\n\nOur giantess leaders come in a myriad of shapes and sizes, and the empire's bloated administrative system lacks efficiency in task allocation. Tall leaders can efficiently clear out rebellious cities on a planet without collateral damage to industrial facilities, but they need to travel for years or even decades on ships to reach their assigned planets. Conversely, celestial-level leaders can reach the empire's borders in a few steps, but the planets and routes along their path are reduced to insignificant specks, adorning their massive bodies.\n\nDriven by the needs of all parties, we need to find a solution to this problem."
  gts_leader_interact.100.a: "Let's see what we can do."
  gts_leader_interact.101.name: "Eureka!"
  gts_leader_interact.101.desc: "A villager from the empire shared a theory with us about something called 'cosmic strings,' which are structures that have existed since the Big Bang. Our universe is like a vast net, but this net is not regular and perfect, it contains various types of topological defects, and 'cosmic strings' are one of them.\n\nThese mysterious substances contain immense energy. Theoretically, even a cosmic string with the diameter of an atom could compress and contain the mass of an entire planet. In theory, if we could capture two cosmic strings close to each other and entangled, the strong gravitational force between them could cause local spacetime curvature, creating a 'shortcut' between two points in the galaxy, a wormhole that even large ships and celestial-level giantesses could pass through.\n\nAccording to our intelligence network, existing theoretical knowledge about cosmic strings might be hidden in two places: one is with the fallen empires with long histories, where our techpriests could research methods to overcome their aging and decaying firewalls; but this might incur the wrath of the fallen empires if discovered. The other source is to find the heirs of the Great Khan of raider civilizations who hoard this kind of knowledge and exchange it for some of our current valuable knowledge."
  gts_leader_interact.101.a: "The old relics at §H[event_target:youlika_fallen_empire.GetName]§! can't keep secrets."
  gts_leader_interact.101.b: "The barbarians of §H[event_target:youlika_marauder_raiders.GetName]§! can't make any use of this knowledge."
  gts_leader_interact.101.c: "We'll rely on ourselves and be self-sufficient."
  gts_leader_interact.102.name: "The Sword of Damocles"
  gts_leader_interact.102.desc: "We have received exciting news from our science team: they have confirmed that 'cosmic strings,' due to their immense mass, can create anomalously strong spacetime curvature in their vicinity. If we can master the complete control technology of cosmic strings, and create a megastructure that can contain them to generate stable wormholes, we could immediately transport giantess leaders as a strike force to any location, this kind of strategic mobility will completely rewrite the rules of war.\n\nHowever, our science team has also pessimistically pointed out that the energy level required to control cosmic strings would be astronomical, and whether our empire can sustain such expenditure is still unknown. Furthermore, attempts to interfere with cosmic strings may be accompanied by unanticipated risks. Given the extreme attributes of cosmic strings, improper operation could trigger chain reactions and cause cosmic-level disasters."
  gts_leader_interact.102.a: "The arrow is on the string, submit the proposal to the council."
  gts_leader_interact.102.b: "My power as [Root.GetRulerTitle] is unlimited. Start immediately."
  gts_leader_interact.102.c: "Every taxpayer has the right to speak. Let everyone discuss it together."
  gts_leader_interact.103.name: "Starbase Operation: Progress"
  gts_leader_interact.103.desc: "The proposal about whether the empire should spend an astronomical amount of resources to build and operate a 'cosmic string' megastructure weapon has quickly become the focus of [Root.GetName]. Due to pressure from all parties, the council had to launch a vote throughout the empire in order to appease the public. Using a normal adult Terran female as a standard, each X-size imperial citizen has X times the voting weight.\n\nAfter a year of heated voting, the proposal finally passed with eleven quadrillion four hundred fifty-one billion four hundred fifty-one million trillion votes in favor and one hundred ninety-one million nine hundred and eighteen thousand and one hundred votes against. Our construction ships can immediately start building the base of the weapon in the capital system §Y[Root.Owner.capital_scope.GetName]§!.\n\nAt the same time, this megastructure weapon which utilizes cosmic strings to sculpt and trim the universe like a work of art also has been given a deterrent name: §YMultiverse Weaver§!"

  gts_leader_interact.104.a: "Infinite power is calling to us..."
  gts_leader_interact.105.name: "Immense Force"
  gts_leader_interact.105.desc: "It is complete. The §YMultiverse Weaver§!.\n\nThis is not just a weapon, but a magnificent spectacle that connects the past and future, and links countless parallel universes. It exists as both a guardian and a destroyer.\n\nTwo parallel cosmic strings gently intertwined, each string has a diameter at the subatomic scale, but carries the mass comparable to a star. These two strings are perpendicular to each other, and intersect to form a seemingly fragile but incredibly solid rectangular frame. Each side of the frame stretches to infinity, like eternal pillars piercing the center of the universe with lengths matching the vastness of the cosmos such that the end cannot even be identified by the naked eye.\n\nThe space inside the frame presents a dizzying visual illusion, like the entrance to a deep tunnel, shimmering with strange light. This light does not reflect from external sources, but is rather the pure energy emitted by the cosmic strings themselves during high-speed vibration. It pulsates in colors and frequencies never before seen by human eyes,  each pulse seems to tell a story from another time and space."
  gts_leader_interact.105.a: "Great, hopefully, all of this effort will pay off."
  gts_leader_interact.106.name: "Joy Turns to Sorrow"
  gts_leader_interact.106.desc: "However, the light of the §YMultiverse Weaver§! only shone for a few brief moments before quickly dimming. The energy flow that had just surged flowed in all directions, and then vanished. All that was left was an eerie silence enveloping our ships and giantess leaders. As if a miracle had just appeared before our eyes, only to be mercilessly taken away by fate.\n\nOur techpriests quickly began investigating the cause. Apparently, the empire's intelligence department, in order to prevent this technology from falling into the hands of other empires through methods like reverse engineering, had replaced some precision components shortly before the megastructure was officially activated. The worst part is that these parts were even smaller than those of some microbial civilizations, and our empire's industrial equipment is completely incapable of machining them to such precision. The current problem facing the Empire is that if they want the §YMultiverse Weaver§! to function again, they must find small person engineers capable of processing these components."
  gts_leader_interact.106.a: "How much longer will we have to wait?! How much longer?"
  gts_leader_interact.106.b: "Having to capture these ants is such a hassle."
  gts_leader_interact.106.c: "Hopefully, the small person scientist friends can lend a hand."
  gts_leader_interact.106.d: "So, does anyone still have any small people they haven't put inside themselves?"
  gts_leader_interact.107.desc: "However, the light of the §YMultiverse Weaver§! only shone for a few brief moments before quickly dimming. The energy flow that had just surged flowed in all directions, and then vanished. All that was left was an eerie silence enveloping our ships and giantess leaders. As if a miracle had just appeared before our eyes, only to be mercilessly taken away by fate.\n\nOur techpriests quickly began investigating the cause. As it turned out, the empire's intelligence department, in order to prevent this technology from falling into the hands of other empires through methods such as reverse engineering, made a last minute decision to replace some precision components shortly before the structure activated. The worst part is that these components were larger than those used by some Titan civilizations. Our current industrial equipment isn't capable of supporting demand. The issue that we're facing as an empire is that in order for the  §YMultiverse Weaver§! To function again, we've got to find giantess engineers capable of fabricating these components."
  gts_leader_interact.107.a: "You specifically chose the biggest parts to replace, you guys are really ambitious..."

  gts_leader_interact.108.name: "Starbase Operation: Tutorial"
  gts_leader_interact.108.desc: "Congratulations, you have now unlocked the §YStarbase Operation§! function for giantess leaders. If this is your first time using this feature, please pay careful attention to the tutorial:\n\n§H① First, select a giantess leader in the Intelligence Exchange Area and click the 'Starbase Operation' button at the bottom left of their panel.\n② At this point, a menu with a fox holding a ball will pop up, with planetary targets on the left and systems level targets on the right.  Planetary targets only involve one planet while system targets affect some or all planets in the target star system. If we have not selected habitable planets, there will be no options here.\n③ With the fox menu open (the previous leader menu can be closed,) go to the target star system. Select a habitable planet that you wish to attack (currently the only function,) and the fox menu will show available Starbase Operations. Mousing over options will provide a relevant tooltip. The leaders' starbase operations on planets and star systems depend on the leader themselves, their body size, planet type, etc.\n④  After confirming the desired Starbase Operation, click it. Then, just wait for the events to pop up.§!\n\n§RAttention:§!\nIt is not recommended to open multiple Starbase operations or leader menus, nor to open other leaders' menus after launching a starbase operation to avoid bugs. Because starbase operations use very crude code, it isn't recommended to use them on special systems (such as crisis systems.) It's usually okay if you're using it in a subjugation war, or war in heaven. Later, we'll consider adding leader-specific and faction-specific Starbase Operations, reducing cooldowns, increasing damage output so that large giantess can destroy star systems, etc. We also welcome anyone to provide content assistance ()."

  gts_leader_interact.1001.name: "Orbital Assault"
  gts_leader_interact.1001.desc: "The [event_target:gts_leader_planet.owner.species.GetName] on [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName] witnessed the arbitrary crushing of fleets by a shipgirl, a being only existing in legends.  They saw her carry away the starbase for her collection before leaving the star system. The government of [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName] convened an emergency meeting and quickly decided to surrender unconditionally, issuing a declaration to (player nation) in an attempt to avoid being ravaged by the giantess land army. Just when the [event_target:gts_leader_planet.owner.species.GetName] on the planet thought they could remain unscathed in this war, a 180km tall portal appeared in the planet's ocean.\n\n§Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! emerged from the portal, her body size, hundreds of thousands of times bigger, shook the planet with just one step out of the portal; even her toes were much taller than the highest peak on the planet. §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! looked around for a moment after exiting the portal, and then began to walk.\n\nThe sea water, unable to even submerge her foot, could not stop the 20km-long giant foot from approaching land. Each step caused kilometer-high tsunamis. On the sea, various warships, large and small, fired upon the raised sole in an attempt to stop the monster's advance, but were mercilessly trampled into the seabed. Even the submarines, on standby in the depths, were crushed into the seafloor before they understood what was happening. Even before reaching the land, this foot had already claimed the lives of tens of thousands, and this was just the outcome of a few steps in the sparsely inhabited ocean.\n\nHowever, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! was completely unconcerned with the carnage unfolding beneath her feet. Her target was an inland area that had failed to disarm as requested.\n\nLooking towards the coast, the entire continent was covered with green lawns and gray moss. The 20km long foot rose from the ocean and blocked out a coastal city. Even though this city had long since disarmed as requested, it could not avoid its fate of erasure. This is considered acceptable 'collateral damage.'\n\nThe time between lifting her foot and stomping it down was less than one second, yet it felt like decades. The [event_target:gts_leader_planet.owner.species.GetName] in the city screamed for help, trying to flee, as if that could save them, but in reality, they could only watch helplessly as the giant foot blocked out the sky and fell towards them.\n\nAs a earth-shattering scream echoed, the giant foot crushed the earth without a trace of remorse. The once-bustling coastal city of millions of people was instantly gone, replaced by a 20km-long footprint.\n\nThis scene was continuously unfolding beneath the shadow of  §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s giant feet. Countless cities, towns, villages and billions of living beings disappeared beneath her feet until she arrived by the inland area that needed to be cleared.\n\nTypically, when using this size for clearing the most common method of is to dig a multi-kilometer-deep canyon with her jade foot to mark a restricted area, and then clear out the small people within the canyon. But today, due to some displeasure at work, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! treats this mission as an outlet of stress, roughly checking the map and begins the clearing. Usually when giantesses are in a good mood, small people could choose their own death, but this time, small people in the whole area could only watch as the giant feet lifted and fell on the ground, with §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! clearing this area very efficiently. Because there wasn't a marked area, many other cities outside the area were also trampled by her giant feet. After confirming that there was no further threat in the area, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! reopened the portal and left the planet. Ultimately, in this landing battle, §G[root.gts_event_kills_logs]§! billion £pops£ people and §G[root.gts_event_city_kills_logs]§! £building£ cities vanished on this brown, footprint-covered land."

The entire planet was covered in deep darkness in an instant. Only the scattered lights from civilization barely illuminated the people on the panicked planet, and also illuminating the true face of the giant object in the sky.\n\n§H(Sniff Sniff)\nThere seem to be lots of yummy foods over here～§!\n\nThe flesh-colored behemoth that took up the view of the planet slowly separated, revealing two pink, fragrant lips and the abyss-like mouth of a young girl. Indeed, the celestial-level girl who arrived beside the planet, rubbing her tummy, and prepared for a feast, was our leader, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!.\n\nHowever, the residents of the planet no longer had the time or leisure to care about who wanted to destroy them. After only a few breaths of the girl, the planet's atmosphere had been polluted and assimilated into §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s body fluid. When §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! lightly opened her mouth towards the tiny planet, the once habitable atmosphere was once again filled with the fragrant breath coming from the girl's mouth, and saliva satellites volatilizing from her tongue-like continent flew out from §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s mouth that could contain dozens of similar sized planets towards [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName], then slammed into the planet's oceans and continents. Within a few mere seconds, the planet was already experiencing super saliva rainstorms covering several continents, and a slimy saliva ocean that inundated the coast for hundreds of meters. \n\n§HHmm… gotta eat quickly, or the food will go bad~§!\n\nWithout hesitation, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! playfully winked at the tiny planet, closed her eyes slightly, and extended her tongue to lick the surface of [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]. Her soft pink meat wall ruthlessly crushed everything on the planet's surface. Countless moss-like cities and dust-like small lives could not even touch the sacred tongue, and were submerged and disintegrated by the deluge of saliva. Even if some survivors managed to miraculously cling to §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s tongue, and were somehow not crushed by her massive, soft meat wall, they might have a chance to witness the interior of §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s celestial mouth from the edge of her mountain-sized tastebuds?"

Just as the people on this planet were discussing the situation with anxious hearts, a massive, milky-white object descended from the light circle. The fine lines on the white giant pillar were clearly visible, with a radiant sunlight gleaming on its crystalline fingernails. It was one of  §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s fingers.

I can't hear anything at all~'§!\n\n§Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!, who was playfully observing the small creature at the tip of her toes, smiled and raised her slender foot and held it above [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName]'s head while playfully wiggling her white toes. Completely ignoring the screams and sobs of [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName] below, and casually crossing her legs, the girl continued in a relaxed tone:\n\n§H'Now, as a leader, you must be much more fun than those boring shrunken disposable people~'\n'So, lick it~ If you stop, I'll step on you~'§!\n\nAccompanied by a loud crash,  §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s bare foot landed heavily in front of [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName]. She slightly kneaded the ground in front of the little creature with her raised heel, and the heat and scent that were released repeatedly ravaged the last bit of dignity that remained in  [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName]'s heart. After some tense struggles,  [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName] finally crawled with boundless humiliation to §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!'s toe, extended their tongue and slowly began to lick the soft and enormous lines of her toe.\n\n§H'Ha... how boring,  I don't feel anything at all...'§!\n\nAfter  [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName] had truly done their best to lick her for a long time, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!, still unamused, yawned greatly, and with no attempt to hide it, wiggled her toes and used them to clamp the almost lifeless little creature. Her large foot was lifted in the air, swinging freely. The sticky foot sweat constantly flowed down the gaps in her toe to the body of [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName]. [event_target:current_gts_country.GetRulerName], all bruised from the abuse by  §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!, could only push weakly against the toe-gaps, which occupied their entire field of vision, and whimper out words to beg for mercy.\n\n§H'Though I really want to crush you to pieces like this...

  gts_leader_interact.2001.desc: "Star systems have always been incredibly vast, and even ancient empires with technologies at their peak have difficulty filling an entire system with their creations.   But for a great being with a celestial-level body, it's nothing more than a slightly spacious self-service restaurant.\n\n§r'Gulp...'§!\n\nThe sound of a girl swallowing her saliva should have been ordinary, after all, it was just a normal physiological reaction of a girl longing for food. But when the source of the sound is not an ordinary girl, but rather a great being with a celestial body, things are different.\n\nPlanets harboring life are what first caught her attention, even though all organic or non-organic matter tastes delicious to her.  But in any case, seeing 'germs' growing on 'candy' always subconsciously drew her in.\n\n§Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! reached out and pinched the only planet in this system harboring life. Thus the earth cracked, rivers flowed backward and cataclysmic tsunamis and volcanic eruptions occurred together - a single casual move by the girl reshaped a planet that had developed for billions of years.\n\nThis single action had already killed almost eighty percent of the life on this planet, but that did not stop them from launching a futile and useless counterattack. Land-based nuclear weapons, powered armor units, and giant ships not yet swallowed by the giant waves unleashed their last fury.\n\nBut it was all useless. Even the ancient stagnant holy powers had no way to save this planet from §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!. After all, she had already considered this planet as 'food,' and something worth enjoying.\n\nThe planet which harbored countless lives was thrown into the girl's mouth. A tongue of blood-red color, in combination with thick saliva which was capable of dissolving everything within an instant, moved in and around the many 'planets' that had been corroded and riddled. After all, what was considered a mother-like being to ordinary life was merely a candy of different flavor to §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!.\n\nThe blue-green planet dissolved the moment it fell on the girl's tongue. All the defenses the civilization had built on the planet, all the shelters they had established, and all the efforts made for their survival, were declared invalid at this very moment. They could only look at the expanding and contracting walls of the crimson flesh and the dissolving of the planet by the glistening saliva and see themselves following in the footsteps of those 'planets' which had been reduced to nothing more than their cores.\n\nHowever, things were not that simple. §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§! seemed to think that simply throwing the planet on her tongue didn't count as savoring it. After all, in comparison to the large stars which she usually devoured, this planet was very small... So after some consideration, the girl opened her mouth, stretched out her tongue in a glamorous position, and then crushed the planet with her finger, smearing it in her mouth.\n\n§r'Gulp...'§!\n\nA loud and deliberate swallowing sound echoed in the star system, broadcast to the entire civilization by the monitoring devices left behind. They did not understand that the girl who had just devoured their planet was only using it as an appetizer. Her main course was a vast celestial body that civilizations called a 'star'.\n\nGas giants with no solid cores were sucked into the air like soap bubbles, and small planets without life were directly captured by her giant tongue, crushed between her teeth and the roof of her mouth, and finally fell into the abyss of despair, tinted red with blood. The numerous planets that had stood in §H[event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName]§! since the creation of the universe seemingly existed only to please this girl.\n\n§r'It's time for the main course~'§!\n\nThe largest star was nothing more than a slightly larger apple in front of the girl, one that would burst with juice when bitten into.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth and bit into the star, and the result was that the star lost one twentieth of its mass - the largest mass loss from the star since its birth. But even a star, even a star that was considered eternal, was merely... delicious food to the girl.\n\n§r'Delicious...'§!\n\nFinally, everything inside of the entire §H[event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName]§!, roughly estimated to be §G[root.gts_event_kills_logs]§! billion £pops£ people, §G[root.gts_event_city_kills_logs]§! £building£ cities and §G[root.gts_event_planet_kills_logs]§! £planet£ planets, all vanished forever within the mouth of the celestial-level giantess, §Y[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]§!...."

  gts_leader_interact.2002.desc: "§H'It's just like a work of art...' §!\n\n[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] murmured, floating quietly in space, with a radiant smile on her soft, pale face, like a lovely girl seeing an interesting little toy.  In front of her face, emitting a faint glow that illuminated  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s massive body and the small fireballs of her hair, was a star we had marked.  Through the observation equipment in the colonies located at the tip of  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s slender fingers, we could even observe several planets orbiting it within this star's gravitational field. However, even the vast star held in the center of the girl's palm was merely the size of one of the girl's knuckles. The nearby dust-like planets, along with the tiny life inside of them, were ignored by [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] who had reached a size of nearly a trillion times bigger,.\n\nSince the successful implementation of short-term gigantification technology, which was used to gigantify several of the empire's non-celestial giantess governors to celestial sizes for planetary modification, our researchers have been looking for ways to apply this technology to celestial leaders. Soon, we succeeded. Once about one billion times in size, the celestial giantess [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] had now been gigantified another thousandfold, finally reaching a magnificent form of a trillion times bigger. Compared to the current [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], whether it's a brilliant star, a wide galaxy, a magnificent fleet, or even a normal-sized shipgirl, everything could be crushed under her toes with ease.\n\nFortunately, although the current [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] was fully capable of breaking away from our empire and turning the empire's territory spanning several star systems into dust trapped within her toes, she was still willing to accept our commands and followed our wishes, arriving near the target star system [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName], ready to bring down a true 'divine punishment' upon this once-prosperous star system.\n\n§H'How cute~ Even though it's just a small fireball that is smaller than my fingernail, billions of microbes have to rely on it for survival~'\n'But it's such a pity... Soon, you'll know what true despair is~'§!\n\nWith a wicked smile, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] gently blew on the star system in the palm of her hand. The hurricane which was full of the girl's scent, mixed with a flood of saliva resembling a galaxy, crashed onto the tiny star system, triggering the most intense cosmic tempest in the history of space in an instant. The planets on their orbits were blown away from their paths, which had been unchanged for billions of years. Some of them were blown out of their gravitational range and crashed onto the star-sized fingerprints of the girl, while the others were completely encapsulated and assimilated by the saliva droplets, which from the girl's eyes were tiny but were the size of a planet. They became a literal saliva planet. Even the star was affected by the saliva and seemed to have dimmed a great deal. Without the interception of the girl's palm and fingertips, those breaths exhaled by [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] would probably travel for several light-years and destroy several nearby star systems.\n\n§H'Pfft...didn't think you would be this weak~'\n'I only blew a little, and now everyone is almost dead~?'§!\n\nThe numbers on the leader panel had increased by several hundred billion as [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]  scornfully mocked the few celestial bodies that were begging for life in her hands, along with microbes that she completely disregarded. The few planets in [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName]  had been turned into a hell of living beings, as the hurricane-like breaths of the girl stripped the planets of their atmosphere, as well as blowing away the habitable crusts and the even tinier starbases. Now, apart from a few units of people who were clinging to life deep in the mantle, this place was completely uninhabitable for any living being."

With her hands slowly separating, and smiling as she watched the star system, which had lost her psionic power, gradually fall toward her body, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] took half a step back and then slowly floated upwards. At the cost of several stars being smashed against the fragrant hair or the delicate arms of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], the girl succeeded in placing the entire star system under her feet and playfully rubbed her toes, giving the intense scent of her trillion-fold foot sweat to the tiny star system without holding back. In the eyes of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], the barely visible droplets of foot sweat floated outwards as she rubbed her toes, each glistening droplet was the size of an oceanic planet. These even tinier 'planets' then fell onto the stars within [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName] and all of its different planets, covering their surfaces with a thick ocean of foot sweat.\n\n§H'Okay~ Game time is over~ Rest under my feet~'§!\n\n[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] smiled and raised her foot, stretched out her white, slender toes and gently pinched the tiny [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName].  In the eyes of the few remaining survivors, the entire sky had completely disappeared into the world of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s toes. The last image in their eyes was only the frail appearing [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName] on an endless background of milky-white, and the soft skin in the grooves of the girl's toes that felt like it was structuring the entire universe.\n\n'Boom...!' §H'Eh? It broke just like that? I didn't even use any power...'§!\n\nAs [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] closed her toes, [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName], along with its §G[root.gts_event_kills_logs]§! billion £pops£ people,  §G[root.gts_event_city_kills_logs]§! £building£ cities and  §G[root.gts_event_planet_kills_logs]§! £planet£ planets completely disappeared into the lines of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s foot, turning into fine grime mixed with the girl's foot sweat and sticking on the girl's toe socket. Feeling somewhat bored,  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] shook her white, star-system sized foot and after once again crushing a few star systems without even realizing it, left that space. Perhaps many years later, somewhere within the patterns of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s toes, new civilizations may be reborn and live parasitically under her feet, under her grace?"

  gts_leader_interact.2004.desc: "§H'Hello everyone~'§!\n\nWith a flash of white light, all life near [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName] was plunged into brief blindness, upon regaining their sight, the microbe-sized natives were horrified to discover that the edge of their star system was completely enclosed by a milky-white behemoth. No matter how high the power level was turned on their detectors, they could not observe the end of this 'megastructure'.\n\nThe true form of this flawless white 'megastructure', was simply the fingertip of our [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], an 'ordinary' young girl. Since passing through the black hole of the End of Cycle, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], who had become a cosmic-level giantess, had left a doppelganger in our galaxy to worked for us. Even though they were merely dust-like tiny doppelgangers in her eyes, in our galaxy, they had a celestial level of enormity.\n\nNow, suddenly feeling playful,  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] decided to descend into this tiny universe even more, a space which was not even the size of her palm, with her true body. When she came to this world as a god, the entire star sea was completely covered by her toes. The observations and experiments made by people through lifetimes, as well as the research of hundreds of years by our empire, were not worthy enough to allow us to see even her ankle above her feet, much less her divine body.\n\nFortunately,  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] considerately used her enormous psychic power to isolate the star system we had marked from the universe, preventing her body from affecting the other areas of the galaxy, otherwise it was likely that when she had just entered the star system, the entire universe, including our empire, would have fallen onto  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s white toes along with dozens of interstellar civilizations, to forever live within the tiniest creases of the girl's toes.\n\n§H'Come to think of it, I haven't used my current body to come back into this universe for so long~'\n'Everyone looks... just like dust~'§!\n\nThe girl's mocking voice echoed throughout the star sea. But as for us, we could only tremble with fear, safely within the psionic shield that [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] had prepared for us, observing her boundless fingertip beyond the barrier which seemed like the background of the universe.   However, even the powerful detection ability brought by the Sentinel Array could only observe two or three fingerprints on [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s fingertips.\n\n§H'Ahem! Okay, okay~ The reason why I came back this time is because I have something to do~'\n'I heard that... it's you guys that are bullying my home~~?'§!\n\nThese words were clearly spoken to the star system at the tip of her finger which wasn't protected. Unexpectedly but predictably, even after becoming a goddess who could obliterate a universe with her hand, our leader [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] still remembered her former nation: the existence of [Root.GetName], and after we had sent the mark utilizing the communication link, she had descended into our universe so quickly, sweeping away hostile forces again as always.\n\n§H'Looks like... I need to punish these disobedient microbes~'§!\n\nThe fingertip that occupied the entire universe gently lifted, pushing the [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName] which was glued to a corner in the lines of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s fingerprints and which contained §G[root.gts_event_kills_logs]§! billion £pops£ people, §G[root.gts_event_city_kills_logs]§! £building£ cities and §G[root.gts_event_planet_kills_logs]§! £planet£ planets towards the outside of the universe. Soon, [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName] had already left our observable range. No one knew what [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] did to that star system.\n\n§H'Okay~'§! \n\nAnother flash of white light, and the girl's body once again became the background of the universe.  And at the location where the star system had once existed, fragments of stars and planets appeared. Celestial bodies completely unrecognizable now drifted scattered around the remains of the star, like a massive cemetery. \n\n§H'It's so hard to leave behind the remains... If I don't restrain my strength and crush those few specks into molecular-level particles, I'll have to waste energy to turn them back into planets...'\n'But this should be enough to remind the other microbes in this petri dish right? Remember to stay far away from my home~'\n'Or else...'§!\n\nThe temperature of the background of space suddenly increased greatly.  The toe socket that covered the entire universe emitted more heat and a significant aroma of feet. The psychic shield that [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] had created was gradually becoming inactive, as if warning civilizations within the 'universe'. Even though we knew that  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s anger wasn't directed at us, the overwhelming aura and sense of oppression still caused all of our citizens to piously beg for the grace of the goddess beyond our universe.\n\n§H'You all should also try to experience what it is like to be submerged in foot grime, to be rinsed by sweat, and to be smothered in a pile of sock fibers for millions of years without being able to truly die~'§!\n\nAfter leaving behind this menacing threat, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] chuckled softly and left this universe, only the remains of the destroyed [event_target:gts_leader_system.GetName] far away for several lightyears, which had experienced a forced torment for millions of years because of the psychic influences, were still remembering the calamity the universe had just experienced."

  gts_leader_interact.2005.desc: "§H'Haa...'§!\n\nHaving just let out a huge yawn, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] idly swung her foot, her long toes, encased in white silk stockings, swept through space, casually shattering a few small asteroids. In front of this foot of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], a dense cluster of small, black dots, almost merged with the deep, black background of the universe, was a once-unstoppable golden fleet.\n\n§H'Is this all the power your weapons have?  A fleet that can't even break my white silk... is there really any reason for you to exist?'§!\n\n[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], looking down with contempt at the fleet in front of her silk-covered toes, gently rubbed her toes together. The snow-white silk threads, impervious to kinetic and laser weapons alike, were brutally separated by the girl's tugging, revealing a wall of moist, pink flesh behind them. The soft, warm, pink toe-gaps seemed to be beckoning the fleet closer.\n\nBut the despairing fleet commander and various military officers had no time to appreciate the beauty of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s toe-gap world. The fleet, simply carrying out its normal duties, was suddenly enveloped in a flash of intense white light and lost all direction and communication. After the white light disappeared,  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName], who had just warped to the front of their fleet, and raised her foot with a playful smile, appeared before their ships. The pure white blanket of silk bore down on the fleet with incomparable pressure. The fleet, which was only instants away from being crushed, unleashed a barrage of its remaining weapons and ammunition, but could not even break a single thread of the girl's silk, let alone damage [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s pale, sweet bare foot and [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s much grander body past the stockings. \n\n§H'I originally wanted to raise you and have you act as cleaning bugs... Now it seems that the only purpose you serve is to be a deodorizing powder for my shoes~ Besides, [Root.ruler.GetName] didn't specify a method of execution this time~'§!\n\nWith a playful smile, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] picked up a short boot that she had casually dropped on the surface of the nearby  [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]. Ignoring the remains of cities clinging to the bottom of the boot, she pinched the top of the boot and leaned down to hold the opening, large enough to hold a small colony, right in front of the fleet.  Hot and humid foot sweat mingled with an intense scent poured out of the opening of the boot, and completely enveloped the entire fleet in an instant. The cloud, filled with the girl's scent, wrapped around the small ships.  Many of the ships with weaker external protective technology had even started to be corroded by the ubiquitous foot sweat droplets in the space, and were pitifully assimilated into liquid by a single drop of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s body fluid.\n\n§H'Alright~ Go inside~'\n'Don't worry, I am very merciful. Even if you are accidentally crushed and flattened inside, or submerged in foot grime, you won't die...'\n'...But your souls will be trapped in my shoes forever, and become my little foot bugs~'§!\n\nMoving the short boot in her hand to slowly enclose the fleet, and playfully shaking her hand to send the fleet to the very bottom, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] smiled sweetly and extended her white silk-covered giant foot towards the opening of the boot. The battered ships of the fleet fell onto [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s hot and humid insoles, those who were lucky managed to fall in the folds of the threads on the insole without being too badly damaged.  And those who were less fortunate fell directly into the mountain ranges of foot grime deep in [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s shoes, where they were completely submerged, or fell into a single drop of foot sweat from the girl's foot where they were dissolved and corroded in an instant.\n\nHowever, as the survivors in the dark world inside the boot looked up towards the only source of light in the sky, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s silk-covered foot had conveniently appeared in front of the boot's opening, while her cute white toes wiggled gently and pressed down on the shoe insole.  However, every single ship in the fleet had already completely lost its power.   The FTL and warp drives which the people had been so proud of had completely ceased to function within the foot-sweat filled air of [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName].  Even the advanced weapons were not able to break the foot grime secreted from the girl's feet. In other words, the fleet was now merely a pile of metallic foot bugs in [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s shoes.\n\n§H'Hmm... they fit pretty well~'\n'You all behave yourself and serve your new mistress~'§!\n\nSmiling gently,  [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] was already wearing the boots.  The few subtle sensations her foot received had caused a blush to rise on the girl's cheeks. The fleet who had once been so mighty and imposing in the entire star system was now only worthy of becoming a plaything and a consumable under the girl's feet. In the depths of that cute short boot, beneath the flat plain of hundreds of meters of foot grime and the more enormous silk-covered foot that was pressing on them, is where the fleet's  §G[root.gts_event_kills_logs]§! billion people would find their end."

 # §H“小家伙们还在负隅顽抗吗？”§![event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]现在正以天体级的大小俯瞰着[event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]，§H“很早就警告过你们了吧，居然还对自己的处境没有清晰的认知吗？看来有必要对你们进行一些惩罚了。”§!\n\n在一整天的跋涉之后，[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]温暖潮湿的靴子为厌氧菌提供了极佳的繁衍场所，浸湿棉袜的汗水和其它附着在袜子上的代谢物被不断发酵，与水蒸气混合着充盈着整个靴内腔室。当她将脚抽出靴子，源源不断的雾气不断冷凝成液滴，构筑成一道晶莹的云团，又在脚背的冲撞下被驱散。\n\n[event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]上居民绝望地注视着被棉袜包裹着宏伟巨足在以极快的速度向自己奔来，五枚圆润的脚趾都如同行星一般大小，在棉袜下勾勒出优美绵延的曲线。当居民们或已经麻木或崩溃大哭笃定自己必死无疑，终于将化作被缠绕在棉袜纤维之中的残渣时，无垠的红墙骤然停了下来。[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]正缓缓褪下棉袜：滚烫的皮肤正散发着热浪，似乎是为了散热，巨足不断地揉动着；红润的足掌近在咫尺，每一条沟壑都清晰可见。居民们这才明白她并非执意要摧毁他们——显然，倘若巨足的主人执意诘难，自己早已粉身碎骨在这一道道峡谷之中了。他们这才开始感念[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]的仁慈，不过惩罚已成定局——\n\n§H“走了一整天，气味可能不太好呢。”§![event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]用食指和中指轻轻撑开袜口，遮天蔽日的红色铁幕将阳光吞噬，连着近地轨道的舰队，一起被打包进入了被足汗浸透的棉袜中。地面上的居民只发现天空落入了无限的黑暗，太空部队拼命点起了荧荧之光，仅仅足以点亮天穹的一隅，使得人们能够理解发生了什么：粗壮的编制物纤维盘虬在一起，逸散的白雾在引力的作用下正不断坠入目标星球之中。不过顷刻间，星球的大气层已经被烙印上了她的印记：白雾在星球上聚成积云，霎时又化作春雨，浇灌着[event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]；小小的居民藏无可藏，被迫呼吸着令人抗拒的气味。\n\n在最后一片夜空之中，只能看见两只纤长的手指轻轻叩上了袜口，[event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]的声音从缝隙中飘进来：§H“那就请你们在我的气味里好好反省吧。“§!她迅速将袜口打上结，[event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]堕入了无止尽的黑夜。只是不知道在足汗的冲刷下有没有使得他们感到一丝后悔呢？
 gts_leader_interact.1010.desc:0 "§H“Are the little ones still resisting?”§! [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] is now overlooking [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName] with celestial size, §H“I warned you long ago, do you still not have a clear understanding of your situation? It seems necessary to punish you.”§!\n\nAfter a whole day of trekking, [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s warm and moist boots provided an excellent breeding ground for anaerobes. Sweat soaking the cotton socks and other metabolites attached to the socks were constantly fermented, mixing with water vapor to fill the entire boot chamber. When she pulled her foot out of the boot, continuous mist condensed into droplets, building a crystal cloud, then dispersed by the impact of the instep.\n\nResidents on [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName] desperately watched the magnificent giant foot wrapped in cotton socks running towards them at extreme speed. Five round toes were all planet-sized, outlining beautiful curves under the cotton socks. When residents were numb or crying in collapse, believing they would die and turn into residue entangled in cotton sock fibers, the boundless red wall stopped abruptly. [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] is slowly taking off her socks: scalding skin is radiating heat waves, giant feet are kneading constantly seemingly to dissipate heat; ruddy soles are close at hand, every ravine clearly visible. Residents realized she didn't intend to destroy them—obviously, if the owner of the giant foot intended to create difficulty, they would have been crushed in these canyons long ago. Only then did they begin to appreciate [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s mercy, but the punishment was set——\n\n§H“Walked a whole day, the smell might not be good.”§! [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName] gently propped open the sock opening with index and middle fingers. The sky-covering red iron curtain swallowed the sunlight, packing the fleet in low orbit into the cotton sock soaked in foot sweat. Residents on the ground only found the sky falling into infinite darkness. Space forces desperately lit up fluorescent lights, barely lighting up a corner of the sky dome, allowing people to understand what happened: thick knitted fibers twisted together, escaping white mist constantly falling into the target planet under gravity. In an instant, the planet's atmosphere was branded with her mark: white mist gathered into cumulus clouds on the planet, then turned into spring rain, watering [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName]; tiny residents had nowhere to hide, forced to breathe the repulsive smell.\n\nIn the last piece of night sky, only two slender fingers were seen gently tapping the sock opening. [event_target:current_gts_leader.GetName]'s voice drifted in from the gap: §H“Then please reflect well in my scent.”§! She quickly tied the sock opening, [event_target:gts_leader_planet.GetName] fell into endless dark night. Just wonder if they felt a trace of regret under the washing of foot sweat?"
 # 好在这只袜子上残存的主人的余温还能帮助他们渡过很长一段时间。

 # 回收棉袜
 gts_leader_interact.1011.name:0 "Recover Cotton Sock"
 # 根据我们安插在袜子附近的眼线报告称，[fromfrom.GetName]的居民们在充分认识到自身的弱小后并没有感到十分丧气，反而十分感激于我们的仁爱，而且积极地利用了袜子内一切可以利用的资源。过去，超量的足汗曾暂时引发过部分地区海平面上涨；现在，他们已经十分熟练地掌握了对足垢中各类成分的提取与开发，而袜子蒸汽所带来的足汗也成为了这颗星球化工、农业、发电等产业不可或缺的资源。另外，由于这一段时间内居民们都生活在充斥着巨娘足味的环境里，他们已经完全度过了与巨娘共处的生理磨合期。如今几乎全体居民都对未来受到我们庇护的生活感到期待。\n\n经评估，这枚星球上的小人们已经理解了我们的用心良苦，并同意接受我们的保护，我们可以将派遣一名专员负责解除将他们困住的袜子。由于他们很可能在棉袜上设置了许多开发设施，我们将十分小心地进行工作，并时刻与他们沟通。届时，我们的专员将协助他们迁出棉袜，并安稳地将他们带回我们的国度，让这些可爱的小家伙们不再受到他人的威胁；而他们的母星将被我们缩小并保存至我们的陈列馆中。
 gts_leader_interact.1011.desc:0 "According to reports from our spies near the sock, residents of [fromfrom.GetName] didn't feel very discouraged after fully realizing their own weakness, instead they were very grateful for our benevolence, and actively utilized all available resources inside the sock. In the past, excessive foot sweat temporarily caused sea levels to rise in some areas; now, they have skillfully mastered extraction and development of various components in foot grime, and foot sweat brought by sock steam has become an indispensable resource for the planet's chemical, agricultural, and power generation industries. In addition, living in an environment full of Giantess foot smell for this period, residents have completely passed the physiological run-in period with the Giantess. Now almost all residents look forward to a future life protected by us.\n\nAfter assessment, the small people on this planet have understood our good intentions and agreed to accept our protection. We can dispatch a commissioner responsible for removing the sock trapping them. Since they likely set up many development facilities on the cotton sock, we will work very carefully and communicate with them at all times. By then, our commissioner will assist them to move out of the cotton sock and bring them back to our country safely, so these cute little guys will no longer be threatened by others; and their home planet will be shrunk and preserved in our exhibition hall."
