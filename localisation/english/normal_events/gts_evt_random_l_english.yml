  ### Careless Soldier (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010021.name: "Careless Soldier"
  gts_evt_random.010021.desc: "One of our giantess soldiers accidentally wandered out of her post and into a nearby 'little people' residential area. Of course, she realized the issue, but after realizing it, she 'accidentally' fell onto the residential area. Now that area has been reduced to ruins, and the surrounding hundreds of square kilometers need to be rebuilt..."
  gts_evt_random.010021.a: "Such a good opportunity! Upload videos from all angles to the interstellar network!"
  gts_evt_random.010021.b: "Turn the personnel in charge into tiny people! Punish them severely!"
  gts_evt_random.010021.c: "Shrink the entire area and block the news."
  ### Little People's Parade (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010031.name: "Little People's Parade"
  gts_evt_random.010031.desc: "According to reports, a 'little people's' parade has broken out on [Root.GetName]. The content of the parade isn't known because the little people are too small and the governor who went to mediate didn't hear it, but what is certain is that the little people have occupied the governor's landing point. Now the governor is awaiting our response."
  gts_evt_random.010031.a: "Kill them all, they are useless anyway."
  gts_evt_random.010031.b: "Let [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName] personally negotiate."
  gts_evt_random.010031.c: "Draft them all into the ground combat suicide squad! Make them atone!"
  gts_evt_random.010031.d: "If it's a matter of money and compensation, that can be easily solved."
  gts_evt_random.010031.e: "Let the governor handle it himself."

  ### Little Person Killer (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010041.name: "Little Person Killer"
  gts_evt_random.010041.desc: "According to reports from [Root.GetName], the local 'little people' have repeatedly reported to the local government that a giantess is destroying residential areas and has brutally killed tens of thousands of little people. They are requesting that local law enforcement immediately investigate."
  gts_evt_random.010041.a: "This behavior can effectively control the excess little people population, but it needs time to improve."
  gts_evt_random.010041.b: "Investigate immediately, this kind of person cannot be allowed to run rampant in our territory, what? I'm talking about the little people!"
  gts_evt_random.010041.c: "This is not conducive to our management, immediately arrest the giantess, and give the little people an explanation."
  gts_evt_random.010041.d: "My little slave people can also try this kind of fun."
  gts_evt_random.010041.e: "Whatever, time will forget."
  gtsra_tiny_home: "Little People's Home"
  gtsra_tiny_home_desc: "Some monasteries have set up things called 'little people's homes'. According to reports, these small houses are provided by the local church to help displaced little people.

  ### Giantess Arena (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010050.name: "A New Kind of Game"
  gts_evt_random.010050.desc: "According to reports, a live entertainment project called 《GPAX》has recently emerged on [GPEX_planet.GetName]. It's being broadcast on dozens of major television platforms and websites, but according to the tax and investigation bureaus, they have neither paid income tax nor personal tax, and they also have a large number of unregistered, illegal little people. We have now arrested the backstage sponsors and the competition founders. How should we handle them?"
  gts_evt_random.010050.a: "A very interesting competition, but we need more professional venues to give our audience and contestants a better experience."
  gts_evt_random.010050.b: "In the universe, only death and taxes are unavoidable. Make them pay their taxes, and then hand them over to those perverts at the Security Bureau!"
  gts_evt_random.010050.c: "The empire doesn't have that much time to manage all this. Just kill those unregistered little people; as long as the giantesses are normal, it's fine."
  gts_evt_random.010050.d: "Hmm~ I think we can open more discreet VIP competitions~"
  #Giantess Arena Construction Complete
  gts_evt_random.010051.name: "Giantess Arena Construction Complete"
  gts_evt_random.010051.desc: "Our first giantess arena has been built. Dozens of media outlets have gathered at [Root.GetName], including not only our country's official media and a large number of independent media, but also media from other countries. Together, they are broadcasting this thrilling, exciting, and standardized sport. But, Your Excellency, do you want to go watch it in person, or just watch the broadcast?"
  gts_evt_random.010051.a: "I'll go in person. I also want to stretch my body. With such a small amount of public affairs, the ministers can surely handle it right?"
  gts_evt_random.010051.b: "No need, there are still many public affairs. The broadcast will do."
  gts_evt_random.010051.c: "Boring stuff, not as comfortable as adding more little people to my massager."

  #Game Start (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010052.name: "Giantess Arena"
  gts_evt_random.010052.desc: "Now, welcome our [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName] to the arena! She will use her own strength to fight against all of the little people in the arena – a full five quadrillion of them!!!\n The arena erupts in cheers, the likes of which have never been heard before. Even the nobles and major sponsors on the VIP seats stand up, eager to catch a glimpse of [Root.Owner.GetRulerName]'s face. \nNow, let's give the most fanatical shout! Let's call out our [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName] to make her appearance! \nAccompanied by footsteps that shake the entire arena, [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName] appears at the giantess entrance of the arena. \nEven though the passage was designed with the maximum size of a Titan-class shipgirl as a baseline, our [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName] still had to bend over to come through. Now, she has straightened her body, and we can measure her data. Everyone, look at the big screen! \nOn the large screen above the stands, the newly measured data is shown: Height, 200 million kilometers!! The remaining data has not been displayed due to confidentiality requirements. \nBut just the height alone is enough to break the Arena's record. Previously, the highest was a few Titan-class giantesses who barely broke the ten million mark, while [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName] instantly raised it to the level of hundreds of millions!\n'Where are those little people? I don't want to compress my height to that small and not be able to see that dust,' she says. \nNow, it's time for the comparison! With the announcer's voice, another set of data is displayed on the big screen: five quadrillion little people, and on the other side, [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName], her number, just 1.\n'Hm~ A very fair match~'\nIf it weren't for the protective shields, the close-by stands would have already been destroyed. \n'Okay, the pleasantries are over. I won't go easy!'"
  gts_evt_random.010052.a: "Go for it! Your Excellency!"
  gts_evt_random.010052.b: "Don't let any of the little people get away!!!"
  gts_evt_random.010052.c: "We need a bigger venue!!!"
  #Giantess Arena-1 (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010053.name: "Giantess Arena"
  gts_evt_random.010053.desc: "Amidst the cheers of the whole arena, she took her first step. Just that first step caused the number of little people on the big screen to plummet by billions. 'Huh? I didn't even see you guys, how did so many die?' It's because of her walking; merely the act of moving caused an earthquake powerful enough to shatter tectonic plates. Billions of little people stationed in fortresses and cities died from this! With the announcer's unlock command, she took off her high heels. 'Ah, this is better. These black stockings were prepared especially for you; not just the little people, but also the audience~'. Your Excellency... she wore the black stockings for us! I... I'm sorry, I'm too excited, I don't know what to say!!! Just because of her words, hundreds of thousands of giantess audience members fainted on the spot, and the hospitals across the entire empire are completely overflowing (If there is a Galactic Medical Center, it will take on some of the patients). However, most people didn't see that the number of little people on the big screen dropped by trillions. The first reason is the action of taking off the high heels, casually tossing down the giant high heels, which crushed tens of billions of little people troops who were waiting to ambush nearby; the second reason is that a careless movement of her feet triggered a larger earthquake, killing another tens of billions of little people."
  gts_evt_random.010053.a: "Continue"
  #Giantess Arena-2 (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010054.name: "Giantess Arena"
  gts_evt_random.010054.desc: "Wow! Her Excellency killed 800 billion little people in less than a minute! This is the record of this arena and a record that absolutely no one else can break! \nWith that said, she took a few steps forward, scanning and observing the tiny, dust-like little people beneath her feet. \n'Little people, how do you like my black stockings today?!' \nThen she stepped down onto the seemingly empty ground, but it's more like she lowered her foot instead of stepping down. However, with just one lift and fall of her silk-clad jade foot, the 4.2 trillion little people vanished to 3 trillion. A single step destroyed so many little people under her feet.\n'Did you die without properly enjoying my grace? It seems my feet are not able to speed up adrenaline production, thereby delaying your tragic lives moving towards inevitable death~'\nShe said, unbuttoning a few buttons on her chest, revealing her enormous breasts, and leaned down to show the little people beneath her her proud chest. \n'Let's see if you can catch these two mountains of breasts!' \nWith this, she lunged forward. With Her Excellency's leap, her enormous figure shook the entire megastructure. And on the big screen, the little people numbers瞬间 dropped from 3 trillion to 100 billion!\nJust a small leap made 2.9 trillion little people disappear beneath her jade body.\n'Ugh~ So it seems my large, soft breasts can’t stop you dust from disappearing either~ well, in that case, let me end your long and boring lives~'\nWith that, she propped herself up with one hand, the other hand slowly, gently crushed the living little people. \n100 billion… 90 billion… 60 billion… 30 billion… 10 billion… 5 billion… 1 billion… 0.\nWith just one hand, with a small movement, with a strange, enthusiastic smile, from the increasingly fanatic cheers from the audience, and the commentator's voice breaking with excitement."
  gts_evt_random.010054.a: "Continue"
  #Giantess Arena-3 (by Abao)
  gts_evt_random.010055.name: "Giantess Arena"
  gts_evt_random.010055.desc: "'Haha, you guys are still pretty interesting. You at least lasted five minutes, hm~ my evaluation is, you were a pretty good stress relief tool~ This is the highest rating!'\n\nAs the numbers on the display for the little people reach 0, the audience's cheers shake the megastructure.\nLess than ten minutes, just less than ten minutes!!! She ruthlessly crushed five quadrillion little people, and no little people survived!!!!!! Let us cheer for our Excellency!!!\nAccompanied by the commentator's passionate reports, the deafening cheers from the  arena call out the same name in unison: [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName].\nAs the name echoes in the arena, she also waved to the crowd to express her gratitude, then left the arena and returned to the backstage.\n'Hm~ It would be good to have events like this from time to time, but I still need a good bath~ Tell the people in the palace to fill the bathtub with water, I want a good soak.' \nAnd from the post-match data comparison, so many little people had fired enough ammunition to sustain a war between two or three empires lasting decades, but for our [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle][Root.Owner.GetRulerName], it was as if she didn't even feel anything. And just like that, the first GPAX competition came to an end."
  gts_evt_random.010055.a: "Very good, I also had fun."
  gts_evt_random.010055.b: "Why not hold a universe-level league and let people from all over the universe participate in this competition!"
  gts_evt_random.010055.c: "Long live the Empire's Glory!"
  ###Footprint Tourism (by CV)
  gts_evt_random.010060.name: "The Rise of a Tourist Spot"
  gts_evt_random.010060.desc: "Recent reports in the major media outlets and a large increase in trade revenue have brought our attention to §Y[footprint_planet.GetName]§! A thriving tourist hotspot, this location is made up of several footprints left behind by ancient giantesses. This location was discovered early in our colony's expansion, but was quickly deemed not to have further research value, thus only simple protection work was done.\"\n\nHowever, as we established more connections with alien races, these footprints were reborn as tourist attractions. Some foreign giantesses discovered that the ancient giantesses who made these footprints had a similar body type. After an incident where a visitor was fined for stepping on a footprint for a size comparison, the person in charge of the area suddenly had a great idea. After confirming the location has no further research value, these footprints were opened to some visiting foreign giantesses-and to engage in some interaction. \n\nIt turns out that this seemingly strange tourism strategy was a great success. The number of giantesses applying to visit this colony has been so high that the Immigration Bureau has had to strictly limit the number of visitors. These footprints have quickly become a well-known tourist destination in media promotion, attracting giantesses from all over the galaxy, as well as little people tourists who come for the sight. Granted, this has placed some challenges on the site's safety management, but at least for now, this phenomenon has created countless jobs for the planet and significantly progressed the economic situation of service industries."
  d_footprint_resort: "Footprint Resort"
  d_footprint_resort_desc: "The footprints left by ancient giantesses, a sudden inspiration from a manager, and proper advertising and management created this well-known resort throughout the galaxy; this area is built around the massive footprints, is well equipped, and has a steady stream of visitors every year, making an immeasurable contribution to the employment and economy of the planet."
  ###Milk-Spraying Shipgirl (by Apricot)
  gts_evt_random.010080.name: "Milk-Spraying Shipgirl"
  gts_evt_random.010080.desc: "We have received new news from the fleet command: despite our engineering department doing its best, one of our shipgirls experienced breast engorgement while patrolling the [shipgirl_milk_planet.System.GetName] system. Because of her shipgirl status, she did not immediately report it, which ultimately led to an unavoidable \"milk spray\" incident when the fleet passed through [shipgirl_milk_planet.GetName].\n\nThis incident caused the sea level of [shipgirl_milk_planet.GetName] to rise, and significant amounts of milk have remained on the planet. While our people are not averse to shipgirl milk, the damage to the planet's facilities caused by such a large amount of milk cannot be ignored.\n\nGiven the different constitutions of shipgirls, we cannot completely blame the engineering department for this situation, but the problem still needs to be properly resolved.\n\nWhat should we do?"
  gts_evt_random.010080.a: "Different constitutions are normal, perhaps we can use this to strengthen our shipgirls."
  gts_evt_random.010080.b: "Giantess milk can sell for a good price among the little people...."
  gts_evt_random.010080.c: "We cannot tolerate this! Plug all of thier nipples!"
  gts_evt_random.010080.d: "Just collect the extra milk."

  #Cheers of the Shipgirls (by Apricot)
  gts_evt_random.010081.name: "Cheers of the Shipgirls"
  gts_evt_random.010081.desc: "Our decision was wise. This incident exposed one of the long-standing physiological problems remaining in shipgirls, and our newly rewritten recruitment agreement will solve this problem permanently, while maximizing the use of giantess milk as an offensive weapon! I believe in the near future, our first milk-spraying shipgirl will shine brightly in space!"
  gts_evt_random.010081.a: "A perfect solution."
  gts_evt_random.010081.b: "I can't wait to see the enemy dissolve in milk."
  gtsra_milk_attack: "Shipgirl Milk Attack"
  gtsra_milk_attack_desc: "Using giantess milk as an offensive weapon, hmm..."
  #"Additional Uses for Shipgirls" (by Apricot)
  gts_evt_random.010082.name: "Additional Uses for Shipgirls"
  gts_evt_random.010082.desc: "Through intensive research from the engineering department, we have unexpectedly discovered a long-standing physiological problem of shipgirls. Due to the protection of shipgirl privacy and their own embarrassment, this problem was not discovered until now. The engineering department pioneered the building of milk extractors in military ports, so that even while shipgirls are docked in the port, they can provide some production for [Root.GetName]."
  gts_evt_random.010082.a: "Sounds like a win-win solution."
  gtsra_milk_recircle: "Shipgirl Milk Recycling"
  gtsra_milk_recircle_desc: "Our automated collection system can collect the excess milk from shipgirls to sell to the little people to save on maintenance costs."
  #Out of Control Shipgirls (by Apricot)
  gts_evt_random.010083.name: "Out of Control Shipgirls"
  gts_evt_random.010083.desc: "We have underestimated the seriousness of this issue! \n\nAccording to reports from the front lines, several shipgirls have experienced milk-spraying during missions. Despite the repeated scolding from the shipgirl instructors and continuous orders from command, these shipgirls were tormented by their swollen breasts and were desperate. Our orders have no effect on them!\n\nThe shipgirls are pulling out their milk plugs, and the unrestrained milk spray is causing major damage to our planet! The caught-off-guard residents can only watch helplessly as the milk flood pours down from the sky, engulfing and destroying everything in its path, eventually drowning in the milk ocean! \n\nWe must do something!"
  gts_evt_random.010083.a: "Oh no!"
  gts_evt_random.010083.b: "Now that it has come to this, we must face it with seriousness."
  ###Duel (by Apricot)
  gts_evt_random.010090.name: "Duel"
  gts_evt_random.010090.desc: "We have received the latest news from [gts_vs_tiny_planet.GetName].\n\nA little person has challenged a giantess, believing that giantesses are just larger humans and are useless except for their size and strength. This giantess has also agreed to this ridiculous duel out of curiosity.\n\nWhile we know this is a one-sided thrashing, nearly all the inhabitants of the empire are watching this absurd match, and [gts_vs_tiny_planet.GetName] has become famous across the empire overnight.\n\nIn response to our interview, the little person who initiated the challenge proudly explained that the so-called unparalleled destructive power of giantesses can only be manifested in ship-to-ship combat on a cosmic scale, or when eliminating clustered cities. When fighting against a little person with great mobility, giantesses can only swat like flies, despite their talent.\n\nHis words have won countless cheers, though you and I know what these cheers mean... \nPerhaps we can use this excellent opportunity to promote the prestige of our [Root.GetName]."
  gts_evt_random.010090.a: "What is this? Quickly end this farce! The empire needs stability, not division!"
  gts_evt_random.010090.b: "Let's make things a little bigger, support the giantess."
  gts_evt_random.010090.c: "Perhaps, creating a little people hero is not a bad choice."
  #Emergency Stop (by Apricot)
  gts_evt_random.010091.name: "Emergency Stop"
  gts_evt_random.010091.desc: "When our mediators arrived at the scene, the whole arena was packed to capacity, and the giantess standing on the left was looking mockingly at the trembling little person on the other side.\n\nGone was his previous arrogance; when actually facing a giantess, he was already shuddering in fear, barely able to hold onto his weapon. It seems like he himself knew that a little person who randomly taunted a giantess would only end up being played with and tortured.\n\nAccording to our mediators, when this small challenger saw the mediators arrival, he completely lost all his composure with his wet pants, rushed to the mediator's high heels, licked them with all his strength, and kept saying things like 'I'm sorry' and 'I shouldn't have been so ignorant.'\n\nThe poor challenger didn't even have the courage to start the match. It's understandable since he was facing a giantess who could have crushed him with a single step."
  gts_evt_random.010091.a: "Glad we arrived in time."

  gts_evt_random.010091.b: "What a despicable bug."
  # Reconciliation (by 杏子)
  gts_evt_random.010092.name: "Reconciliation"
  gts_evt_random.010092.desc: "It seems our mediator did the right thing, using this national broadcast to loudly proclaim the idea that small people and giantesses should be equal and mutually helpful.\n\nAlthough everyone was here to watch the challenger get toyed with by the giantess, \nregardless, now that they've seen him in such a pathetic state, our citizens are satisfied.\n\nIn short, this event was the perfect opportunity.\nOf course, after taking a commemorative photo, this arrogant challenger was, as usual, given to the giantess as a personal item."

  gts_evt_random.010092.a: "Good."
  # Mockery (by 杏子)
  gts_evt_random.010093.name: "Mockery"
  gts_evt_random.010093.desc: "It seems our mediator did the right thing, using this national broadcast to loudly proclaim the idea that small people should eternally submit beneath the giantess's feet, and be inferior to even their foot dirt.\n\nShe immediately kicked this ignorant little bug to the feet of the giantess who accepted the challenge. In this national broadcast, the lovely girl demonstrated how to use small people to clean the dirt from the bottom of her feet.\n\nI believe that when he was submerged beneath the giantess's foot, his humble pleadings and screams could stir the passion of all giantesses and let all small bugs know that the only consequence of resisting a giantess was to be toyed with to death.\n\nThis challenge ended hastily when the little guy suffocated in the girl's panties. As usual, we only broadcast the edited version; the full version was sold on the black market."

  gts_evt_random.010093.a: "Truly multi-purpose."
  # Let's Start! (by 杏子)
  gts_evt_random.010094.name: "Let's Start!"
  gts_evt_random.010094.desc: "Not only is the match venue packed, but almost every resident who couldn't attend is watching the livestream, witnessing a duel that will change history. This is just too crazy!\n\nThe girl accepting the challenge stands confidently to the left, excitedly waving to everyone. On the other side is...oh no, it seems the challenger is in a bit of a bad shape.\n\nNo, it's more than a bit of a bad shape; he looks like he's about to die from fright!  Whether it's his trembling legs or the fact that he can't even hold his weapon, it seems like he's never faced a giantess before!\n\nIt looks like the winner is already decided.  We can interfere and support one side, perhaps this could consolidate our empire."

  gts_evt_random.010094.a: "Yes."
  # Day of the Duel (by 杏子)
  gts_evt_random.010095.name: "Day of the Duel"
  gts_evt_random.010095.desc: "Alright, the battle has begun!\n... \nThe battle is over?\n\nIt seems our challenger didn't want to fight the giantess at all. He was just talking big before. As soon as the battle started, he screamed and ran towards the exit.\nAs if he could actually escape beneath a giantess's feet!\n\nThe girl just moved her foot, and this arrogant wretch was stepped on under the girl's sneaker, forced to rub back and forth under her sole as she hummed a song. Any mobile equipment and sharp weapons all turned into garbage under the feet of the giantess.\n\nWhen the girl lifted her foot, the poor wretch's clothes were crushed, his whole body red, and his mouth was left with only unconscious mumblings like \"Mommy\". But our challenged seemed unwilling to let him go, and gave all the viewers a vivid demonstration of the \"Small Person Toilet Paper Use Guide.\"\n\nBy the time the battle ended, he had multiple fractures throughout his body.  It seems that this duel ended up being a farce."

  gts_evt_random.010095.a: "As expected."
  ### Small Person Food Processing Plant (by 115)
  gts_evt_random.010100.name: "Small Person Food Processing Plant - New Best Sellers"
  gts_evt_random.010100.desc: "There are small person shops on the street, and posters on the roadside advertise a certain company's new small person products. Today, I went to the supermarket as usual to buy a box of pleasure small people and a box of food small people.\n\nI hurried home, finally having time to rest after a long day at work.  I got undressed until I was just in my underwear, and lay exhaustedly on the bed, scrolling on my phone. I casually opened a box of small people and spilled them on my body, enjoying the subtle sensations on various parts of my body as I surfed online. Then, I opened a bag of small person food and crammed handfuls into my mouth.  After watching an episode, I had finished the whole bag, then pinched the flesh on my stomach, bemoaning that I had gotten a little fatter...\n\nWith both hands full of the small people to be eaten, a large number fell from between her fingers and the edges of her palms to be smashed into oblivion as she was swallowing and chewing. She was just eating carelessly, licking, and occasionally using her tongue to lick at the parts that were about to fall, or poking them with her fingertips to make the small people fall into her mouth faster. Finally, she sucked her fingers with satisfaction, patted her hands, and stood up from the continent covered in footprints, pits, and traces of licking to go and play with the next small person nation.\n\nThere were no survivors - the small people either waited in her belly to be digested, were pulverized under her feet, or eked out a living between her teeth - sooner or later they would be picked out by her flexible tongue to become food, or even crushed directly with her tongue."

All personnel inside the city should immediately head to the nearest underground shelter, and should not open the shelter door until the alarm has stopped. Warning: Large amounts of ejaculate will immediately destroy buildings along the path; do not stay in your home.\n\nAfter the Ejaculate Flood Disaster has ended, the city's reinforced drainage system should be activated to drain all internal ejaculate. The accumulation of large amounts of ejaculate inside the city will cause all the people inside to become mindless sex machines under the stimulation of estrogen.\n\n(Note: 7795 culture dish cities have been abandoned because of this.)\n(Note 2: Perhaps one could try using the ejaculate to speed up the reproduction of the small people?)\n(Note 3: This is not a reason for you to apply for hundreds of culture dish cities per month, staff member Warfarin.)"

The resulting individuals can effectively remove foot dirt, sweat, salt particles, and corpses from the lines on the soles of the feet. The special miasma marks will constantly expand inside shoes and socks, acting similar to sweat-absorbing insoles.\n\n(Appendix: Sea-borne is a special type of creature that can endlessly evolve; we should be in awe of it. If anything happens with this product, I will hang you on the bridge, Warfarin.)\n(63-day appendix: I really didn't expect this product to sell so well. The speed of cultivating the Sea-borne in the lab is almost unable to keep up with sales. Contrary to our expectations, we had thought these Sea-borne would evolve into terrible monsters, but they can't even withstand the environment of a foot bottom with lots of sweat. Even when their bodies start to rot due to absorbing too much sweat, they are still doing their best to clean feet, as if this thing was born to clean feet!)\n(Doctor's Note: I was wondering why the staff members' feet had become so white and tender, with no smell at all. Isn't this stealing my work?  Starting today, stop all sales of this species within the ship.)"

  ### First Construction: Miniature Person Production Plant (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010140.name: "First Miniature Person Production Line Put Into Operation"
  gts_evt_random.010140.desc: "Since our empire made contact with the tiny small-person races in the galaxy, our colossal giantess citizens have been especially fond of these insect- or dust-like 'living toys.' However, before entering the faster-than-light era, our only ways of acquiring these creatures were inefficient methods like capture and artificial breeding. However, through the full use of genetic engineering and cellular cultivation we are able to produce, on a large scale in this vast factory, independent miniature people with varying personalities.  Furthermore, the Imperial Propaganda Department has declared that these individuals are merely \"products,\" thus our girls are now able to use these miniaturized persons without any psychological burden.\n\nCurrently, this factory is capable of producing various types of miniature persons, including disposable, edible, external massage, and pet-grade.  The cultivated individuals, under the unified management of our staff, can be rapidly distributed throughout the empire, to be used by giantesses in their own ways.  In addition, investigations reveal that many other miniature people are trying to sneak into the production line of pet-grade miniature people by various methods. Our solution is to leave these stowaways to the factory's giantess staff for their own use, which has even indirectly stimulated the abundance of jobs in the factory."

  ### First Construction: Miniature City Assembly Plant (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010150.name: "First Miniature City Assembly Completed"
  gts_evt_random.010150.desc: "As the empire's contact with faster-than-light civilizations becomes more frequent, the giantesses' desire for ever greater domination grows even more pronounced. However, though our giantesses are completely capable of destroying cities and even continents on any small-person planet in the galaxy and enjoying it, the negative impact that too much trampling and playing around has on interstellar diplomacy cannot be ignored. Therefore, the project for self-producing miniature cities solely for the purposes of destruction and entertainment has long been on the agenda, and the corresponding large miniature city assembly plant has also been completed today. The first orderly, yet sufficiently minuscule miniature city, filled with a large number of small miniature people, appeared beneath the feet of our giantess researchers, to their delight.\n\nAfter gaining approval, one of the science officers unhesitatingly stepped on the miniature city with her silk stocking-covered foot.  Countless 'skyscrapers' were instantly crushed into a smear of dust on the girl's sole, and the miniature people previously placed in the city were equally unable to escape the fate of being crushed. They gloriously became tiny red dots among the threads of the girl's stocking.  After stepping on her foot with satisfaction, the Science Officer gave the assessment: \"The foot feel is nice.\""

  gts_evt_random.010160.desc: "Cultivating a civilization, the empire's long-held dream. The birth of a miniature civilization is not only for entertainment consumption, but also the essence of the empire's technology gathered into one. And now, with the advanced development of our sociology and micro-engineering, the first micro-civilization has been cultivated. A blue planet is quietly suspended in the center of the culture chamber. For our Science Officer §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!, although this tiny planet is not even as big as her palm, it carries the existence of billions of microscopic small people. Even if we remove the protective barrier on the surface of the planet, the only thing those microbes would see is just a small patch of skin on §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!'s cheek. It might take them thousands of years of development and exploration to barely explore a wrinkle on §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!'s body, not to mention how a fragile civilization like this would be destroyed even if exposed to a girl's breath.\n\n\"Data shows that more than eight billion miniaturized lifeforms exist on the planet, but even with just a light touch, or a stomp, or a lick, these microbes will, together with their planet, be turned into dirt or nutrients on my body... A long period of research has already made me understand that the difference in size is insurmountable for these microbes, something they cannot understand, cannot escape from, even in their entire life.\"\n\nAfter transmitting this message, our Science Officer §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§! gently opened the barrier on the planet's surface and removed the planet, then ended the communication. Although we don’t know how §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§! will end up using that civilization, various kinds of micro-civilizations purpose-built will soon become a new fad toy amongst the giantesses in the empire."

  ### First Construction: Giantess Bodily Fluid Refinery (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010170.name: "A very \"fragrant\" refinery"
  gts_evt_random.010170.desc: "Since our civilization entered the faster-than-light era, the giantess races in the galaxy have always been like a sword of Damocles hanging in the sky above our planets. Due to the absolute disadvantage in terms of physical size, the individuals and even cities of our race are usually crushed or consumed when facing those massive, mountain-sized giant girls.  Even the few giantess empires willing to maintain a gentle attitude cannot avoid the unconscious destruction of us; many once prosperous cities are, along with their citizens, reduced to a smear of dust under the giantesses’ silk stockings.\n\nHowever, after countless rebuilds and experiments, we have unexpectedly discovered that there are a large number of valuable materials beneficial to the empire in the bodily fluids of the giantesses.  Whether it be precious minerals or scarce alloys, all of these can be extracted successfully from the sweat or ejaculate of giantesses. Due to the enormous size of giantesses, we can easily obtain large quantities of foot sweat or ejaculate from the cities or planets that have been destroyed, and the refinement project for those liquids has officially begun.\n\nThe first giantess bodily fluid refinery has been assembled on one of our habitable planets. However, since the bodily fluids of giantesses often seem more intense when seen under hundreds to thousands of times higher magnifications, and the fluids of those rarer celestial-level giantesses can appear to us as godlike and untouchable, we’ve had to place the refinery in an area far from residential districts, and have it operated by trained specialists in order to prevent mass unconsciousness caused by the odor of giantess foot sweat, or citizens going insane within the scent of ejaculate."

  ### First Construction: Giantess Underwear Recycling Station (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010180.name: "Work Among the Threads"
  gts_evt_random.010180.desc: "As our empire's interaction with other races in the galaxy becomes more frequent, our understanding of those giantesses becomes deeper. Of course, with gains there must be losses. The number of times giantesses 'visit' our colonies also gradually increases. Whether it be observation, play, or trampling, these giant girls often mischievously drop their shoes, socks, or panties on nearby planets or directly on the land before they leave. The overflowing scent and filth often submerge large areas. A city unlucky enough to be directly struck will be crushed into a few wisps of dust under the fiber of the material. However, while our scientists endured the humiliation and stench to try to study those woven fabrics that were large enough to change the landscape of a planet, they were pleasantly surprised to find that the giantesses' personal garments were also an unexpected fortune for us small people. It seems to be a good choice, whether extracting giantesses' ejaculate between the fibers of enormous panties, or mining minerals from the foot dirt mountains made of dirty shoes and socks.\n\nFor this reason, the empire has begun to collect the discarded massive clothes left behind by giantesses on the planets they have visited, and uniformly transported to giantess underwear recycling stations for classification and use. This giant building, which occupies nearly an entire continent, is specifically used to store those mountain-like magnificent undergarments of the giantesses. After classifying those for various uses, they are collected and processed. Of course, to prevent citizens from getting lost in those skyscraper-like threads, this building also requires more professional personnel to carry out various work so they are not overwhelmed and crushed by the ejaculate in the panties or the foot dirt in the socks."

However, if you were to do so, all our proposed Terms would no longer exist.  §Y[Root.Owner.GetName]§! would probably find it hard to start our cooperation...\"\n\nA long silence followed. The immense, sailor-uniform-clad girl silently sat before a similarly large table, silently staring at several courteous though not servile diplomats of §Y[Root.Owner.GetName]§! on the table. After a long while, the giantess girl sighed gently and signed her name on the documents beside her.\n\n§H\"…Okay, I agree, little people,\"§!\n\nThe above footage comes from the first negotiation session at the empire's newly completed Giantess Diplomacy Countermeasure Office. This is also the magnificent beginning of our civilization’s final peaceful coexistence with the giantesses. Based on the ever-growing technology and economy of our civilization, some giantesses from other empires have agreed to assist our empire under our proposed terms. With their help, some prospects that were once unimaginable for us have been achieved.\n\nFor the first time, our citizens no longer needed to scatter away when facing those sky-covering figures. The people who have been cast in the shadows by huge silky feet will be caressed with friendly soles instead of being consumed and crushed. We can colonize and survive on the continent-like bodies of giantesses, and we can explore the starry skies with these close allies as well. From Titan Giantesses to the tiniest of tiny people, the individuals of our civilization all believe that this will be the beginning of a harmonious coexistence between giantesses and small people throughout the universe."

  ### First Construction: Small Person Specialty Shop (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010200.name: "Large Scale Miniature Person Specialty Shop Now Open for Business"
  gts_evt_random.010200.desc: "With the further development of the giantess population within the empire, the demand for miniature person products is also growing. Fortunately, with the help of the large increase in the technological level of miniaturized person industrial production and the \"legal acquisition\" of small person species in the galaxy, we are now able to sell high-quality miniature person products to the giantesses in the empire in large quantities. We can ensure that every struggle or plea for mercy under their silk feet or between toes can bring the girls maximum pleasure.\n\nThe report submitted by the investigation department shows that this small person specialty shop has already sold tens of thousands of differently scaled miniature person products on its first day. Whether it’s normal-sized small people used for trampling under giant feet or for pleasure in private parts, or microscopic level small people that can be raised in shoes and socks, all of them have been well-received. At the same time, the expansion of sources for those products and usage of them has already been put on the agenda, because for our great race, even an ordinary footstep of landing is enough to crush thousands of miserable small people.”"

  ### First Construction: Miniature Person Sanctuary (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010210.name: "Miniature Races Officially Granted Complete Protection"
  gts_evt_random.010210.desc: "Since the empire entered the faster-than-light era, our giantesses have shown a rather strong fondness for the petite creatures in the galaxy. The distinction between miniature person products and individual members of small-person civilizations quickly became prevalent throughout the empire. People generally believe that since giantesses have such enormous bodies, they should naturally do what they can to protect these tiny intelligent lifeforms. However, given the obvious size difference between the two, countless small people are inadvertently crushed under the giantesses’ feet or consumed in food.  Science Officers also often accidentally step on large swathes of tiny cities during landing inspections, and many small-person civilizations end up as dust stuck to the soles of silk stockings. Now, this situation has finally improved.\n\nThe establishment of the first miniature person sanctuary provides a great observation place for giantesses in the empire who are committed to harmonious coexistence with small-person civilizations. A broad gray city spreads out across a plaza-like area, and the hundreds of billions of intelligent small-person individuals raised within it can live peacefully. Although the difference in size between the small people and us is extreme – one shoe or a pair of silk stockings of a giantess is enough for them to live and multiply – at least this area provides them with a haven within the dangerous galaxy. Of course, the only drawback is that due to the planning and reasonable utilization of resources, most of the food consumed by the small people here comes from the filtered bodily fluids or foot dirt of giantesses, and the consumables they use are almost all the shoes, socks, or panties that the giantesses casually throw aside. However, this is still much better than waiting on one’s own planet to be toyed with by other giantess empires."

  gts_evt_random.010210.a: "May they live peacefully under our management."
  ### First Construction: Small Person Research Institute (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010220.name: "Miniature Intelligent Life Research Initiated"
  gts_evt_random.010220.desc: "If we only consider their physical size, how those miniature people individuals so much smaller than us maintain their physiological functions has indeed puzzled our scientists for a long time. If we also consider the even more minuscule microbe races, the fact their cell-sized bodies are still capable of the basic physiological activities of an intelligent life is nothing short of an unsolved mystery.  However, the appearance of the first small person research institute in the empire will greatly help us resolve these problems.  As for the test subjects… we can always find small people who 'volunteer' to cooperate.\n\nIf research in the fields of physics and engineering only requires dissection or physicochemical experiments on miniature people, then the research in the field of sociology is much more interesting. Our Science Officers have conducted a large number of investigations on these miniature person test subjects, both for experimentation and for amusement.  For example, they placed a large number of small people, adjusted to the appropriate size, all into a pair of long boots that had been left to fester for several days, and observed their struggles in despair. Another example, they ordered a microscopic small people to climb to the top of a breast several kilometers high, which was under a human hand that slowly moves downwards, in order to test the function of their bodies. Or, they would secondarily miniaturize all of the miniature people individuals, except one lucky one, then observed the behavior of the small person who retained their original size. Each miniature person who failed the experiment was usually disposed of in various ways by the experimenter as a failed product.  Those lucky ones that successfully completed the experiments will receive the reward of living a week in our Chief Science Officer’s shoes before the next experiment."

  ### First Construction: Small Person Red-Light District (by 花田)
  gts_evt_random.010230.name: "Entertainment Venue Catering to Size Differences Completed"
  gts_evt_random.010230.desc: "It is obvious that for the giantess races widely present in the galaxy, toying with the small person races can create a considerable sense of pleasure and domination. Based on this, whether it’s using biomass to generate electricity or opening a large number of entertainment facilities dedicated for the purpose of toying with miniature people, all can provide our empire with abundant energy coin resources. The \"Small Person Red-Light District\" facility was created in line with imperial support. A large number of devices have already been pre-installed, allowing the giantesses in our empire to use various means at will to trample and toy with those miserable miniature person lifeforms. Of course, the incredibly immense body of the giantesses and the sense of oppression they bring may also be an enjoyment for some small-person civilizations. Therefore, occasionally we will also receive a few small-person citizens from other civilizations who provide enough energy coins to visit the facility. We delegate several giantesses to have some fun with those small clients in a manner that will not cause them harm.\n\nSo far, the facilities in the small person red-light district have already reached considerable size. Hundreds of millions of miniature person products are transported here every month to be consumed by the giantesses. They will be distributed according to different scale factors. Small people at the percentage scale size are often used as deodorant in giantesses' shoes or as small sweat absorbing sponges used to wipe the body, while the 1/10,000 scale people will be filled into miniature cities and then be intentionally or unintentionally trampled on by giantesses as disposable carpets, eventually becoming a wisp of dust or a trace of blood under stockings.  As for the ultra-micro miniature people at the 1/1,000,000 scale, they will be placed, like microbes, in special foot sweat culture dishes. Giantesses can then smear them randomly on the surface of their bodies before letting them live and die on their planet-sized skin. Moreover, each giantess who visits this place will also receive a centimeter-scale foot-slave miniature person as a souvenir when they leave."

  gts_evt_random.010250.desc: "With the expansion of the empire’s territory, the increase in inter-stellar trade has allowed the citizens of §Y[event_target:gtsra_random_event_planet.GetName]§! to enjoy various convenient products from other planets.\n\nIn an ordinary household, a little girl is looking for suitable clothes on a faster-than-light communication forum. Although her family's income can only maintain a basic level of living on the planet, they can still obtain economical products from afar with the support of faster-than-light communication.  Just right, her panties should also be replaced with a new pair... Thinking of this, she quickly turned on her communicator and quickly found a pair of panties she liked and placed an order.\n\nHowever, one minute later, the §Y[event_target:gtsra_random_event_planet.GetName]§! government immediately issued a global alert: a huge unidentified flying object was flying toward them. Currently, the object's surface appears to be white, and there seem to be huge, inexplicable blue stripes underneath. All calls to it are unanswered. Its close distance and super high speed also prevent the interceptor weapons from reacting. Even if the government had issued a warning, there wasn’t much time for them to escape.\n\n“Look, what is that thing in the sky?”\n“It’s white… are we going to be hit?”\n“Wah--I don’t want to die yet--I haven’t seen my idol Miss Jiaran yet--”\n“Why does this thing look like a crumpled up pair of panties…”\nSoon, with a “thump--” heard from the planet accompanied by the sounds of something unfolding and impacting the ground, all became silent...\nThe accident report left everyone stunned and not knowing whether to laugh or cry: because the child had failed to select the specific product style, the store had sent a pair of panties, assuming the default size to be a Titan-level giantess. Because of the high-tech of the other party, the store chose to use instant teleportation for delivery, thereby the massive pair of panties flew directly above the planet. It soon slammed into the surface of the planet. The unfolded panties covered several provinces, sucking dry the surface water of the area - luckily it didn’t land near the ocean, avoiding a larger global disaster.\nThe investigation for the losses caused by the accident is still in progress. However, to look on the bright side, at least the item was delivered, right?"

  gts_evt_random.020012.desc: "It's obvious that someone higher up had a little selfishness when choosing the location, selecting the largest metropolitan area on this planet. In a nationwide broadcast, a shipgirl who had been waiting in orbit for some time descended on the outskirts of the city at ten-thousand times the size of the local residents.  As she raised her black silk-clad foot specially swapped for this mission, her huge sole aimed toward the most central part of the city before stomping down fiercely to begin the program.\n\n Tens of thousands of buildings disappeared instantly under her huge foot, and the tens of millions small people inside were also turned into mincemeat under her heel. When the black silk-clad foot was raised again, what was captured on satellite images was no longer the once bustling city center but an ultra-large footprint that was brown, 27 kilometers long, and 10 kilometers wide.\n\nThe shipgirl looked at the footprint, where magma was gradually rising, smiled lightly, and then began using her feet to stomp, drag and even write on the city.  Sometimes she would crouch down to observe carefully and play with the city between her legs with her hands, or she'd just simply lie down and use the dug-up city to caress her breasts and private parts.\n\nDuring this one-hour disaster, the largest metropolis on this planet, along with several surrounding satellite cities, were reduced to toys used by this shipgirl to vent her stress. According to the probes on the shipgirl's body, 565,231,792 people died directly or indirectly in this action before the end. This figure was also broadcasted, and it's likely that the resistance movement has been greatly suppressed, while we have also shown the universe our powerful side."

Many small people began to lick the nuns’ high heels as a sign of determination, and the nuns also followed the wishes of the small people and took off their high heels, showing their jade-like feet covered only by white stockings without any reservation for worship. They were also giving the favored believers to put inside the shoe as a reward.\n\nAs the nuns in various areas of the planet completed the baptism of the small people under their feet, the entire planet was renewed.

  gts_evt_random.020015.name: "Out of Control"
  gts_evt_random.020015.desc: "We sent orders to the giantess who had completed her mission, informing her to leave this planet and return to the starbase to wait for orders. But after hearing the instructions, she took off her communicator and crushed it with her foot. She looked up, showed a very dark smile to the camera satellite, and then walked away from the designated area.\n\nSince the giantess was lightly equipped and wore almost no equipment, we could not place any restrictions on her activities. Therefore, on this planet, there was nothing that could stop this 180-kilometer tall giantess. Even the highest mountain on this planet was only a pathetic 10 kilometers high. The giantess simply raised her foot and stomped the highest mountain several kilometers deep. The giantess walked forward. Every step she took caused the cities to disappear under her black silk-clad giant foot. The satellite was still following the live feed. She had not interrupted the connections between the probe and the satellite. Every time she stepped onto the ground, the number in the upper right corner of the live feed would increase by hundreds of thousands or even millions, this increase would be even more if she stepped onto a large city.\n\nThe giantess had a clear goal. It seemed like before she started her action, she had already looked over the major and minor hubs of the small people on this planet and planned her route. Nothing could stop these 27-kilometer-long giant feet. The clouds were torn apart by her black silk-clad feet, and the enormous air pressure caused by the falling speed instantly crushed the small people within the city.  Then came the intimate contact with the ground, repeating this scene with a time cost of only 1 second per step.\n\nAfter the giantess efficiently eliminated the cities of the continent she was on, the original clean black silk was already covered with various stains from the land. She walked to the beach, took off her black silk, threw it towards an island not far away and then went into the sea. However, the sea which could barely cover the instep of the giantess was not enough to stop her actions. Every step forward would generate a tsunami that would be tens of times larger than any recorded tsunami on this planet. Although the speed of the tsunami could not match the speed of the giantess’s movement, it would cause immeasurable destruction in places where the giantess would not go.   The distance from the sea to the coast of the opposite continent is 10,000 kilometers wide, but for a giantess at a 100,000 times bigger scale, it was only a mere 100 meters. It only took her less than a minute. The cities of the opposite continent also welcomed these giant feet."

  gts_evt_random.020016.desc: "The only way that we have to stop this tragedy is to send other space shipgirls of the same size to the planet to stop her. We dispatched two shipgirls who were also undergoing maintenance at the starbase to this planet. The estimated time needed is 2 hours. During this time, we can only watch as this giantess efficiently eliminates the small people on this planet.\n\nAccording to post-event statistics, the original population of this planet was 5,482,000,000 people.  After this event, according to the probes carried by the giantess, 5,139,588,582 people died.  This once beautiful planet has been riddled with holes and covered with giantess footprints, with no cities of 100,000 or more people left. The destruction also caused the planet's ecosystem to suffer a very thorough destruction.  We expect that this planet will not return to its original state for several decades, if not centuries.\n\nAlthough we quickly blocked the news after the situation spiraled out of control, it is very unfortunate that countries all over the universe are now strongly condemning the actions we have taken. This will make our diplomacy in the universe very difficult in the foreseeable future."

  gts_evt_random.020021.desc: "Without any of our interference, this shipgirl demonstrated how to efficiently eliminate the small people on the entire planet at this scale of one hundred thousand.\n\nSince the largest city on this planet had already been destroyed, the remaining cities could basically not withstand even one step from this giantess with 27-kilometer-long feet.\n\nIf it was a miniature city, she could crush it completely by simply walking normally. For slightly larger small cities, after her foot stomped down, she would drag it left and right. If she encountered medium-sized cities, she would have to use her other foot to assist in flattening them. Alternately she would raise one foot high above the city center and stomp down hard, which could achieve the same effect.  Large cities were more tricky, and she needed to step on them several times to ensure the entire city was flattened. There were also oddly-shaped cities, such as those that stretched in a long line along a valley.  For those she would step on one end of the city on tiptoe and then drag her foot to the other end of the city…\n\nAfter several hours, the shipgirl arrived in front of the last city. This city was fortunate, and was surrounded by huge footprints from this shipgirl that were densely stacked on top of each other, but it had inexplicably managed to survive the massacre from the past few hours.  However, this shipgirl did not intend to let this lucky city go. She lifted her huge foot, which had already stepped on and killed an unknown number of small people, toward the last city. Without hesitation, this final city was equally honored with a visit from this large foot, and was squashed hundreds of meters into the ground.\n\nAfter stomping on the last city, this shipgirl confirmed that there was no sign of small-person activity on the entire planet. She then walked to the sea, lightly dragging her feet through the water and churning the entire planet's ocean into mud.  After confirming that her feet were washed clean, she leaped heavily into space, but the land under her feet could not withstand such force, and the entire continent instantly cracked open, and magma spewed out.  But the shipgirl, who had already jumped out of the planet and into space, just looked back at the planet, which was now entirely brown, and smiled.  The previously beautiful blue-green planet was long gone, leaving only countless giant footprints."

The small people on the planet watched as the entire sky was gradually occupied by [root.GetRulerName]'s body. Finally, [root.GetRulerName] stopped growing after reaching 200 million times the original size and looked at the 5-centimeter planet in front of her. She took off her shoes and rolled the planet between her silk-stockinged feet, crushing the mountains , and the sea was absorbed by her stockings. At this point, the planet could still barely withstand the pressure from [root.GetRulerName]'s feet, but the life forms on the surface of the planet were not so fortunate. In a short while, all of them were crushed to death under [root.GetRulerName]'s feet.\n\n[root.GetRulerName], seeing that the surface of the planet had been peeled off by her feet, then gradually used more force to squeeze the planet, which now had no life left on it. As more and more cracks appeared on the planet's surface, magma from within the crust erupted from the cracks. Finally, the planet could not withstand the enormous pressure produced by [root.GetRulerName]'s feet and surrendered to them.  [root.GetRulerName]'s feet came together, and the enormous impact force caused the north and south poles of the planet to split and fly into space, while the portion that failed to escape was crushed into fine pieces, becoming many insignificant asteroids in the universe."

  gts_evt_random.020023.desc: "This is the 7th day after this planet was occupied by a giantess. Apart from the interruption of communication with the former country, the lives of the small people haven't changed much. Everything continues as usual, but without warning, [root.GetRulerName], who is ten thousand times the size of the local small people, steps from space onto the capital of this planet. [root.GetRulerName] looks down at the small people scattering in fright and decides to try an idea she had long considered. Using her powers, she lifts all the small people on the planet into the air and then gathers them under her, placing a protective shield on each small person before stacking them continuously until forming a giant tower made entirely of small people.\n\n[root.GetRulerName] looks at the completed tower of small people under her, takes off her panties and throws them aside, spreading her already wet vulva open with her hands, making sure she's aligned with the small people tower and slowly lowers herself. Because of the protective shield, the small people are not crushed by the immense pressure within [root.GetRulerName]'s body. As [root.GetRulerName]'s waist sinks lower, the layers of flesh within her vulva begin to writhe. The entire vulva becomes excited because of the insertion of the small person tower, squeezing the tower layer after layer, constantly drawing the small person tower into the depths of her vagina. Once the base of the small person tower has also been swallowed by the greedy opening, the top of the tower touches her cervix. [root.GetRulerName] wiggles her waist in satisfaction, using a little force to mold the small person tower into the shape that best suits her vulva.\n\n\"Get ready to move~\"\n\nAfter saying this to the small people inside her vulva, [root.GetRulerName] begins to move her hips, raising her buttocks to pull the vulva away from the tower, squeezing the small people tower left and right within the warm vaginal chamber as she twists her body. When she pulls out of the vulva, the small people on the outermost layer of the tower are stripped from the tower's body by the friction against the vaginal walls. When the buttocks is at their highest point, the small people at the very top of the tower are held between the two labia, while the rest of the small person tower is completely exposed to the lascivious air with a large amount of glistening love juice. But the next second, [root.GetRulerName]'s buttocks drop rapidly, the two full cheeks crashing heavily on the ground of the city. The slick vulva also pierces straight through the small people tower in one go. The small people at the top of the tower struggle to push the flesh walls to the side and then slams into the clitoris, causing [root.GetRulerName] unbearable pleasure. [root.GetRulerName]'s buttocks rise and fall rapidly, each time releasing a large amount of love juice flowing into the city. But with a loud cry echoing across the globe, the vulva contracts violently, and intense pleasure continuously flows from the vulva. As her spinal cord impacts her entire body, [root.GetRulerName]'s body tenses and trembles uncontrollably.\n\nWhen the climax is over, [root.GetRulerName] gets up with her vulva tightly closed, worried that even one small person would leak out. After getting dressed, she leaves the planet. But the price of pleasure is that all the small people on this planet..."

  gts_evt_random.020024.desc: "The strange earthquakes tonight have been going on for a long time, sometimes strong, sometimes slight. But these don't seem to be the short, continuous vibrations that have been experienced in the past, but rather rhythmic and long-lasting tremors. This has caused the entire city to be in a state of panic and confusion. But as the tremors intensify one after another, a black shadow can be seen from the city, appearing on the distant horizon and approaching the city. This shadow is also gradually becoming clearer in the moonlight. When this shadow is about 100 kilometers away from the city, the small people in the city can finally see the full picture of this shadow. It's [Root.GetName]'s [root.GetRulerName]. The earthquakes that began a few hours ago were actually caused by [root.GetRulerName] walking. She is \"strolling\" at a size ten thousand times that of the local small people. Thanks to this planet's highly urbanized nature, each step of [root.GetRulerName]'s has landed accurately in the cities of the small people. Although the residents of this planet witnessed how the giantesses of [Root.GetName] overwhelmingly destroyed the defenses of this planet a few days ago, the giantesses who landed at that time were only a thousand to ten thousand times the size of the small people. The size difference of one hundred thousand times has still made this city chaotic. Countless small people are fleeing in the opposite direction of [root.GetRulerName]. Car accidents and stampedes are constantly happening. It seems that [root.GetRulerName] doesn't even need to step down; the city has already completely lost its function. It's a pity that [root.GetRulerName] was already tired of this scene a few hours ago. Not a single city hasn't become chaotic because of her arrival. Perhaps if this city had evacuated its residents in an orderly fashion, [root.GetRulerName] would have been merciful enough to pass over. [root.GetRulerName] raises her right foot towards this city. The remnants of the city constantly falling from her stockings confirm her achievements in the past few hours. She put her heel in the suburbs of the city, and her sole covered the entire city. After a few nimble twists of her five toes, the giant foot descends and then rises, and the screams of the small people in the city rise and fall along with this movement. With the help of enhanced hearing, [root.GetRulerName] can hear the voices of the small people under her feet clearly. This size difference satisfies [root.GetRulerName] very much. She begins to caress her private parts through her long dress. But after a few times, [root.GetRulerName] is also tired of this game. As the number of times increases, the small people's screams become smaller and smaller, making [root.GetRulerName] gradually feel bored. Just when the small people thought that this giant foot would continue with the previous motion, the giant foot unexpectedly didn't stop. Instead, it stepped on the city without reservation. The sound from under her disappeared, and everything returned to silence with a dull rumble.\n\n\"Ah, is this the last city? If I had known, I would have played more,\" [root.GetRulerName] looks at the phone in her hand and finds that all the small people gathering places that can be considered cities on this entire planet have been consumed by her \"stroll\" in the past few hours. She reluctantly looks down at the huge footprint under her feet.\n\n\"Well, let's find something else. I still have a lot of time left.\""

Looking at the largest city on this planet under her, the giantess kneels on the city, aiming her unerect penis at the city. As the futa giantess's penis slowly erects, the pink head of her penis, hidden under the foreskin, slowly probes out. The entire city becomes dizzy with the aroma emitted from this penis, and even begins to worship it. But the giantess doesn't care about the feelings of these small people. As she feels a cold sensation coming from her fully erect penis, she realizes that her glans is touching the ground. Almost the entire city disappears directly under her giant penis. After getting used to the coolness, the giantess's waist slowly sinks down, and her entire penis, with a few small cities around it, digs into the ground.\n\nThe giantess's posture changes from kneeling to lying down. Her 1500km-long penis completely penetrates into the interior of the planet. The mantle is hot, and the pressure tightly wraps around her penis. It feels like the planet's vulva. Feeling the planet's warm welcome, her penis seems to become harder and bigger.\n\n\"Let's be gentle first, so I can enjoy it later.\"\n\nThe giantess's waist begins to move up and down, letting her penis thrust inside the planet. The tight pressure and the scorching temperature soon bring her penis to its critical point. With a small gasp from the giantess, she ejaculates!

  gts_evt_random.030040.desc: "[gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]'s stomach, which usually seems a bit spacious for small people, can now even be considered crowded. Small people swallowed in handfuls almost filled the bottom of the stomach. The space for people to stand was also very limited. A feeling of despair spread among the crowd. Everyone, at least everyone who had fallen here with their body intact, knew that this place was to be their execution ground.\n\nThe slightly moving stomach walls only made people more restricted; feeling the filling of food, it had already begun its work. The glistening gastric juices made the crowd involuntarily move away from the flesh wall, where they could previously lean against and rest for a moment.\n\nPeople looked on with the light of the flashlights that some could still turn on, watching the digestive fluids constantly flowing out of the surrounding flesh walls, gradually accumulating at the bottom of the stomach. The eerie silence remained, and only the sounds of the body's natural activity echoed. Those at the bottom began to retreat involuntarily, while those at the top tried to avoid being pushed backwards into the flesh wall secreting digestive fluids. However, the surrounding environment was clearly becoming more active; some people took advantage of this opportunity to whisper their last words."

Soon, those on the outside, facing the pool of digestive fluid that was constantly approaching them, found that they could no longer retreat. Some were still trying, while others closed their eyes, counting down the last few seconds of their lives.\n\nThe first person lost their footing and fell-he pulled down the second; the searing pain of the digestive fluid made them scream instinctively-this scream finally ignited the despairing atmosphere that had been accumulating among the crowd. The crowd, which had already been compressed as much as possible, finally collapsed. \n\nSome people jumped into the approaching death, while more people, in their moment of fear, tried to hold on for one more second. The stomach, which was previously silent, finally became lively. It seemed to sense the activity within, and the surrounding jolting became more intense-[gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]'s digestive system was working at full power."

Such heroic acts were also occurring equally within this chaotic hell.\n- Such sounds were covered by the shouts of more people and the \"thumping\" heartbeat which dictated her work of execution. \n\nIn the middle of this chaos, the digestive fluid gathered from a pond into a small lake, and then gradually submerged even the ankles of those at the highest point. The surrounding noise decreased, but the lingering fear of those who were still alive continued to climb. The remaining few couldn't help but look at each other-and then, as the ground beneath their feet sank, the digestive fluid went over their heads.\n\nFinally, everything subsided. The \"gurgling\" sound filled the air, and that was the digestive system turning the remains of what was once full of life- and the terror of dying-into sufficient nutrition for [gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]."

  gts_evt_random.030090.desc: "As the most courageous group of people in the small person world, the pioneers have made great contributions to the expansion of the small person civilization with their fearless and adaptable nature.\n\nThe story begins with the small person pioneer team inside §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!'s shoes. The first small people who set foot on this land found it to be pitch black, damp and stuffy. The only source of light was the light that came into the shoe opening. Terrible odors permeated the air. They had to wear air filters in order to live properly, but despite the harsh environment, the mineral reserves and water content were abundant -- although the latter needed to be filtered several times to be used normally. \n\n At first, small people died one after another from not adapting to the environment. Their corpses were corroded by foot odor, turning into white bones buried on the insole continent. Over time the bodies became part of the shoe pad’s grime. But many more small people successfully settled on the insole of §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!'s shoe.\n\nInitially, the small people's settlements were scattered throughout the insole. The settlements at the arch of the foot were sparsely populated due to the extremely strong smell. The five dark basins inside the shoe had rich minerals (foot grime) and water, which were very suitable for small people to live in. Gradually, the small people developed the five most prosperous cities at the toe prints (the level of prosperity is determined by the size of the toe indentation). If nothing changed, the ordinary lives of the small people would continue like this until that certain day… On that day, all the small people inside the insole heard a huge vibration from the ground. The animals began to flee blindly, and the buildings began to collapse. People fled the buildings and hid in the open, looking towards the opening of the shoe to know what had happened. \n\nSuddenly, something blocked the sunlight from the shoe opening-it was the huge foot of §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!.\n\nThe five toes, pressed together, slowly entered the shoe, contacted and flattened the insole cities located at the heel. Then, it slowly moved forward, uniformly flattening, crushing, and turning all the cities on its path into the insole grime. Finally, when §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!'s entire jade foot had entered the shoe, her toes were already hanging over the cities located in the toe basins. Only then did the small people realize why this was the area with the richest resources, but it was too late...\n\n\"Hmm... the insole feels a little scratchy today. Did some sand get into my shoe?\" \n\n§H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§! rubbed her toes and stomped her foot again until there was nothing abnormal. After that, she went out wearing the shoes.\n\nAnd the small people on the insole had been nearly wiped out in this disaster. The small people who managed to survive at the arch of the foot worship the giant foot of §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§! as a god, and generations upon generations have dedicated themselves to working on the arch of the foot for odor removal."

One by one, cities and surrounding mountains and land were picked up by her tender white fingertips and savagely stuffed into the all-devouring vulva. But for her, the cities of the small people weren't even enough to be used as lubricant...\n\nThen what can be done? After all, humans are really that insignificant.\n\nThey look at each other in despair. The whole planet is squished by the giantess who was made enormous and now stuffed into her vulva and crushed into a thin strand of bloody juices.\n\nBut they still have a homeworld, don't they~ With a single drop of the giantess's remaining juices, these insignificant creatures that clung to her clitoris are living far happier lives than other races in dire straits."

Just last week, new government personnel arrived at their home, presenting a document stating that their spouse had received the honor of \"promotion\" for their outstanding work. Subsequently, they took their spouse away. Now, several days have passed, and they have received no news of their spouse. Inquiries to government departments have only yielded perfunctory replies stating that their spouse is fine. They can't help but imagine the worst. They are angry, they are sad, yet they are helpless, unable to fight against a greater power.\n\n\"Honey, are you home?\"\n\nIt's their spouse's voice! [root.GetRulerName] excitedly stands up, rushing towards the door of their residence, so agitated that they don't even notice where the voice is coming from.\n\n\"Not over there, dear, come to the balcony.\"\n\nThe spouse's voice pulls [root.GetRulerName] back to their senses. When they reach the balcony, their legs buckle instantly. Their spouse, no, rather, a colossal head with the same face as their spouse is looming there. The electronic patterns on the face, the slender metallic ears, and the enormous body below the head, glowing with metallic sheen and feminine curves, remind [root.GetRulerName] that this is the new ruling race of this planet now.\n\n\"Don't be in a daze, dear, am I pretty?\"\n\nShe fully stands up, her enormous body obscuring the sky, making her seem even more graceful. The metallic wings that spread behind her make her look like a deity made of metal.\n\n\"Honey, is that really you?\"\n\n\"Of course, it's me. Oh, well, not entirely,\" she grabs the apartment building where her spouse is, uprooting it, just to get a closer look at her spouse.\n\n\"What's here now is just a part of me. My main body is outside this city. As a reward for promotion, they made this city my earring.\"\n\nShe nonchalantly walks into the city, her high-heeled feet mercilessly crushing the vehicles beneath her, smashing the houses in her path, just like those metallic giants did on the day the city fell.\n\n\"Honey, you just…\"\n\n\"I can see it. It’s unavoidable. Rather than that, maybe after this…\"\n\nThe spouse excitedly talks about their plans to enjoy some alone time. However, [root.GetRulerName] cannot listen at all. They know that their spouse has completely become one of those giant tyrants. There is an insurmountable and tragic barrier between them now."
  ### 来自星辰的女神
  gts_evt_random.040110.name: "Goddess From the Stars"
  gts_evt_random.040110.desc: "\n\"Hh...be careful…slowly…\"\n\nIn an unlocated star system within the galaxy, an unfamiliar celestial giantess is floating naked within the gravitational field of a star. Two immense emerald-green pupils, similar in size to moons, are intently staring at a land planet directly in front of the giantess's long, fair right foot. The planet is only 0.1 astronomical units away from the giantess's big toe. The twinkling lights prove that a sapient civilization exists on the planet, but it clearly has not yet entered the era of faster-than-light travel. If viewed only through the image signals sent back by probes, the ordinary planet seems to be much smaller than the giantess's toe.\n\nAnd now, this giantess, who is playing with the tiny planet with great interest, suddenly moves her planet-sized toe. Her vast sole and the giant toe, which seems to still be steaming, are slowly being pressed toward the small land planet under the giantess’s control. The wide toe gaps slowly open with the giantess's unconscious movement. A gust of air mixed with the giantess's body fluids and pheromones rush out of the toe gaps. It will take about three system hours for it to reach, and sweep across the entire planet. At the same time, the giantess slightly opens her mouth and mumbles:\n\n\"Too far away to catch the little people, too close exceeding the Roche limit will tear apart the little people's planet... So troublesome, so troublesome... However, raising little people on my toes seems to be this troublesome after all...\"\n\nSoon, the giantess's efforts produced results. The atmosphere of the land planet was first stripped away under the gravity of the giantess's toe, and drawn to the area around the giantess's toe. Next, what needed to be attracted were every single minuscule little person. However, even the simplest of actions, like moving a toe, is an apocalyptic sight for the little people on the planet…\n\nThe originally azure sky is occupied by a patch of white. Just a small area of skin under the giantess’s toe pad has already domineeringly taken over the sky the little people had dreamed of for numerous nights and days. Subsequently, the giant toe, beyond the Karman line, is still slowly and steadily approaching the planet. Countless toe lines, as large as continents, swipe across the sky at an incredible speed, as if the sky has collapsed. By now, the nightmare of the little person civilization is not yet over. Information sent from a dust-like moon indicates that another toe next to this one is starting to open to the other side, and a cosmic surge of unknown components has rushed towards the planet from the gap between the two toes. But just as the government of the little people started to react, the flow of air emanating from the giantess’s foot, carrying foot sweat and dirt, had already arrived on the planet. The unimaginable smell and foot sweat that fell like rain instantly shattered many cities on the planet. Countless little people suffocated due to being unable to adapt to the giantess's foot scent. Even the atmosphere of the planet started to be replaced by the giantess's scent.\n\nSoon, the saying of “Goddess from the Stars” began to spread like wildfire on the little people’s planet. The remaining little people who could adapt to the giantess’s giant toe swarmed to the streets, declaring that this was a blessing from the great goddess. Seemingly to confirm the saying, the remaining little people and tall buildings soared into the sky, gradually leaving the small planet under the giantess’s greater pull, flying toward the paradise called \"toe\".\n\n\"Is that…enough? Feels pretty good…\"\n\nThe celestial-level giantess, who had been maintaining her posture, carefully wiggled her toe at this moment. Under this enormous disturbance, the tiny planet, including all of those who were still resisting, was shattered completely. All that was left was a batch of little people barely surviving in the toe lines on the giantess’s toe tip. If those little people who had been drowned by the giantess’s sweat and crushed by the dirt under the giantess’s foot were excluded, the remaining little people might not be able to cross even one toe line of the giantess in their remaining lives, and could only become microbes raised on the giantess’s toe tip forever.\n\n\"Yay-now I got little people on my toes～ I won't be laughed at by my sisters anymore～\"\n\nThe giantess's body disappeared in a burst of light. The celestial-level giantess happily left this star system, leaving behind a shattered planet in orbit, as if still narrating the adventure that had happened."

The intense stimulation causes the giant girl's legs to clench suddenly, pressing against both sides of the planet. Her clitoris, rolling back and forth, is like a plow that deeply turns over the local crust of the planet. What follows is a torrent of love fluids rushing forth.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhh…\" The giantess has a completely stimulated expression. Fortunately, a timer had been set beforehand, otherwise, the planet would have been directly submerged under her masturbation. \"Huuah…um…this should have irrigated enough of the agricultural district...wuu-ee...sorry for bothering everyone…\" "

However, obviously, the amount of sweat, as much as a massive ocean planet, was not within the design purview of the engineering department.\n\nNow, the shipgirl is telling us through the screen, with an embarrassed expression, that the surface of her feet is almost completely covered with foot sweat.\n\nPerhaps we should think about how to solve the ocean-like amount of sweat on her body?"

The enormous beads of sweat, carrying the shipgirl's body temperature, trickled down from her fair bare feet, directly hitting the poles of §Y[event_target:gts_feet_sweat_planet.GetName]§!. The glaciers could not withstand the steaming sweat. The planet's clean water resources turned into white wisps of smoke that tried to escape because of the temperature of the foot sweat, but could only be captured by the gravity of the giant feet, pouring their remaining coldness into the planet-sized toe gaps. The planet's oceans couldn't even dilute the foot sweat. Soon, almost all the water on the planet had become a product of this shipgirl's foot sweat. The low-lying colonial districts had long been submerged by the rising oceans of foot sweat, but this is not the end.\n\n§E\"Huu…finally, I can rest a bit…\"§!\n\nAccompanied by a wronged voice, the shipgirl finally placed her bare foot on the planet's surface. In an instant, mountains collapsed and the earth broke apart, unable to withstand the weight of her toes. The cities she used to cool off were already countless in number. But even more desperate were those who were not trampled or crushed in the first instant. The entire planet was rubbed back and forth between the shipgirl's bare feet. Before long, our colony had been completely tainted with her smell and body temperature. The small planet tried its best, but only managed to provide a tiny bit of coolness to the giantess. It had long since become a steamer overflowing with foot scent under the shipgirl's unconscious rubbing.

With just a 'plop,' the magma flowing inside the planet, the blood of a star, submitted just like that to the little girl's foot sweat. With each rub, it finally turned into specks of foot grime on the bottom of her foot.\n\n§E\"Hmm…although it's a bit small, it's really comfortable!\"§!\n\nWhen the shipgirl finally released the poor planet, the planet had already turned into an ocean planet completely made of the giantess' foot sweat.

The event began in the Forle Earth of the Nightlorn Star Cluster. This planet was originally a level three civilization planet, with balanced civilization development, highly developed technology, and a peaceful social environment. However, with the descent of the Goddess Xi, Forle Earth and the neighboring planets were nearly destroyed. With immeasurable monstrous strength and an invincible physique, Goddess Xi, in the name of entertainment, wantonly destroyed the structure of planets, turning prosperity and life into nothingness.\n\nBehavior Analysis of the Research Subject: According to descriptions from local survivors, Goddess Xi was wearing a deep black jk uniform. Her steps carried an invisible tremor, and her eyes seemed to contain disdain for all existence. The planet's gravity, the stability of the atmosphere, and the balance of the core collapsed with a touch as if they were fragile sand castles. \n\nEyewitness Accounts: A survivor named Elaine described it this way: “She is like walking disaster. Our cities, our homes, are not even worth a glass marble in front of her. She can make everything turn to silence by a light pinch. Our pleas for mercy, even when they became a river, could not stop her. The endless despair is like screams forgotten in the dark.”\n\nResult and Follow-up: On the day of the incident, millions of lives on Forle Earth instantly disappeared. The civilization structure suffered devastating blows. The only things that were left behind were broken ruins for later researchers to mourn and analyze. What followed was a series of chain reactions as other planets in the star cluster fell one after the other, destroying the stability of the Nightlorn Star Cluster and directly impacting tens of billions of lives.\n\nThe STELLSRIS event once again reminded the various civilizations of the galaxy of our lack of understanding of hyperdimensional entities and our insignificance and helplessness when facing the power of an unmatched creator. In history, there are virtually no survivors who confronted Goddess \"Xi” directly. From her casual actions to her godlike power which could erase planets, it tells the lives of the universe that there are some powers that are always higher than reason, higher than life and death.\n\n[Current State of Goddess Xi Individual]: Unknown\n[Actual Strength Potential of Goddess Xi]: Immeasurable\n[Event Losses]: Calculating, preliminary estimate of damage is star cluster level. This file will be stored in the Galactic Civilization Archives for future research and preparation. The outcome of the event makes all rational lives feel heavy, strengthening their respect and fear towards the unknown power of the universe. Today, whenever Goddess Xi is mentioned, people can't help but think of the godlike power that destroys planets and the endless despair. It has become a cautionary legend that spreads between the stars."

If you do not want your friend to end up under your shoe, when interacting with your small-person friends, please ensure that they are not on the same surface as you or are always in your line of sight.\n\n2. The surface tension of water is fatal for your friends. When you find that your small-person friend has been surrounded by water, gently wipe them off with a cloth you carry, rather than licking them into your mouth.\n\n3. Due to their small size, most small-people have low self-esteem. This can cause them to distance themselves and leave when you regard them as a good friend.  Therefore, if you are sure they have feelings for you, and that their leaving is due to low self-esteem, please do not give them a chance to escape from your sight; show them your attitude through your actions.\n\n4. Due to some “historical issues,” please try to avoid mentioning words such as “insects” or “ants,” which are contemptuous terms referring to small things, in front of your small-person friends to avoid causing unnecessary unease.\n\n5. In fact, small-person friends are neither repulsed nor disgusted by touch or stroking, but please seek their consent before doing so.\n5.1 The stroking in this rule refers to light touch by the hands. Please do not use other body parts such as the tongue tip or the sole of your foot.\n\n6. If you want to invite your small-person friend to dine with you, please prepare appropriate cutlery or at least a raised platform to ensure that your small-person friends and the food are not on the same level.\n6.1 If you do not have a raised platform or special cutlery, please ensure that your small-person friend eats on the same side of the table as you and not on the opposite side. This can prevent them from having psychological discomfort from directly seeing you eating.\n\n7. If your small-person friend needs to stay overnight at your place, please do not let them share the same bed as you directly to prevent your actions in your sleep from causing unnecessary harm to your small-person friend.\n\n8. When you need to move around with your small-person friend, please obtain their consent before placing your hand in front of them so that they can climb onto your hand by themselves, rather than reaching out to grab them. In special circumstances, you should directly grab your small-person friend.\n\n9. During your interactions, you do not need to overly care for someone just because they are a small-person. That will make your small-person friend feel uncomfortable. It would be appropriate to let them help you with some things that they are capable of and encourage them. This will deepen your relationship with them."

One day, a ship belonging to a somewhat slow-witted little foxgirl from a neighboring star system accidentally arrived in §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§!'s bedroom due to a hyperspace jump error.\n\nIt happened that §H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§! was sitting at their desk handling official documents when a small toy spaceship suddenly landed on the desk. A few cute foxes jumped out of the ship. One was trying to investigate and understand their current location; another looked at the crashed ship helplessly and sat on the ground crying; the rest were clumsily rescuing crew members trapped inside the ship.\n\nThey completely did not realize that there was a giantess several hundred meters above them, observing their clumsy behavior with great interest......\n\n§H[event_target:gtsra_random_event_leader.GetName]§! has already grown tired of the boring official work, and was immediately drawn to these unexpected little guests, thinking about how to play with these little ones next~"

The planet's largest mountain range in the north was replaced by huge piles of excrement.

  gts_evt_random.040220.name: "Message from a Distant Star System - ID 379123"


  gts_evt_random.040220.desc: "On a battlefield of some planet, two armies faced each other, war drums thundering as they fought for every inch of ground, giving no quarter.\n\nBut why were the soldiers, meant to charge into battle, raising their heads instead, staring intently at the sky? Because a stain the size of a city shouldn't be stuck to the actual sky, should it? Nor should it have neat, uniform lines, or a dull grey color, right? A giant boot landed nimbly on the ground; and being a single-footed landing, the girl wearing the boot had to flail her arms to barely keep her balance.\n\n'Ugh... finally arrived. Okay, okay, let's see... This mission should be to shrink and then slowly destroy a country...' \n\nWhile fiddling with her communicator and muttering to herself, the girl started walking in the direction of her objective. Perhaps noticing she stepped on something, she just casually dragged her canvas shoe across the ground, kicking off some dust, without ever looking back and continued her mission. As for that chaotic battlefield with ten thousand troops? Ah, maybe some crushed bits and pieces could be found in those two huge footprints that could each fit several cities? After all... even a shrunken giantess's foot, with its sky-covering size,  is too much for those insignificant little germs to bear. Some unfortunate recruits hadn't even made contact with that hallowed sole; their armor already bursting from the immense pressure.\n\n'How much money will be left after this job... That star looks really yummy...' \n\nThe carefree high school girl traversed the vast earth... or rather, what was once vast earth. To the giantess’s massive canvas shoes,   'vast’ was indeed something of a misnomer. Potholes everywhere, and the small bumps and towns that are everywhere made the upset high school girl feel rather annoyed.\n\n'Hmph... You truly have no eyes, building stuff in places that would annoy me when I’m thinking...' \n\nThe girl grumbled, stomping hard on a small stain on the ground. Not feeling satisfied, she stomped everything nearby again and again, until the surrounding area became a flat, yellow field, and only then did she lightly snort, and with a disgusted look, rubbed her shoe on the one small city that was barely left, saying, 'Disgusting'.\n\nPerhaps the little people in the city didn’t even have time to think about what was happening, as they watched, stunned, as the huge girl scornfully flattened hundreds of miles of rivers and mountains. Whether it was tall buildings and great walls, or dense forests, or powerful crossbows and cannons, all of it turned to dust under the girl's pair of world-destroying canvas shoes. Seeing an array of powerful earthquakes tearing the land, breaking the sky, they ultimately watched as that shoe sole moved towards them... On that dirty shoe sole, the little people could barely make out what their buildings once were... Of course, after the giantess used the city as a carpet to rub the soles, everything ceased to exist. When the huge high school girl finally left, those who had survived the destruction and trampling, mustered their courage and crawled out of the basin-like ruins. What greeted them was desolation, a deathly silence, a total loss of hope, and a fate of being forever imprisoned within the sinkhole that the girl's whim had created... Of course, the girl paid no mind to the countless screams and pleas for mercy from those under her feet. The unstoppable giant foot crushed the city walls which were not even obstacles as it stepped into what is touted as the commercial center of the city. With the giant foot grinding left and right, the entire downtown area was locked inside the circle that the toe had drawn.  The little people, still enjoying the dazzling array of goods and food on the commercial streets just a moment ago, now realized that the sole of a shoe, covering the sky, had filled the whole sky above, and bits of corpses and shattered buildings were filling the streets. Then, the people scattered in a panic; they were desperate to find that the mischievous giantess had already drawn them an inescapable prison.. Fragments of ruined buildings were embedded in the cliffs of the unfathomably deep cracks, next to crushed limbs and bones. Yet… when the little people look up at the huge canvas shoe… they are unable to find even the slightest trace of red…\n\n'Ah, ah... After walking so long, finally time to play around.'\n\nContentedly stretching her arms after her tiring walk, the girl sat on the ground, staring at the prison she had created. \n\n'So... You guys are the target then? The capital of the civilization to be destroyed?'\n\nLittle did the girl know, her butt was right on top of the greatest temple in that very country. The two giant, soft mounds that pressed through the clouds plunged downwards, and in an instant, almost 100,000 little people who had come to worship were killed under the high school girl's hefty behind. As it turned out, if by the giantess’ own intention or just out of pure chance, that magnificent temple fell just one millimeter away from her rear. What could the devotees do other than stare at the terrifying aura that was continuously spewing out of that pair of jeans? Oh that’s right…  they could also go and pray to the gods that they believed in. As if reaching her limit, a burst of air came out of those giant jeans, the chaotic air current sweeping away everything behind the girl, tearing the little people and their buildings into the sky, smashing and shredding, all dissolving into a cloud of blood splatter on the girl’s tiny butt. When everything settled, there was no trace of the little people left behind the girl. The top layer of earth was easily lifted up, with remnants of the disaster discarded amidst the brown soil... As for that pure gold statue of god inside the temple, likely together with the building, and the hundreds of devotees inside, they were torn apart by an ethereal aura."

  gts_evt_random.040230.desc: "Pitch black, nothing at all. How long have I been asleep...\n\nThe naked girl sat up in this endless void of darkness, rubbing her eyes.\nIt's so dark... why is it so dark? ...She reached out and groped around, her hand touching a hard, weighty object.\nWhat is this...?\nThe girl grabbed the handle of the weighty object. It was an axe, an axe of immeasurable weight, yet the girl easily picked it up. She swung the axe hard, and the darkness echoed with a dull thud, then the darkness split apart.\n\nThe girl looked at the blinding light and couldn't help but close her eyes. Chaos had been divided. Slowly, light and clear things rose upward and became the sky. Heavy and turbid things fell downward and became the earth. The girl’s immense body stepped on the ground, leaving her footprints on the surface of the earth - these footprints later became the oceans, and they will surely merge again one day...The girl stretched her body to support the heavens, her toes pushing hard against the ground. The distance between the sky and the earth grew higher and higher, and the girl’s body became more and more enormous. Finally, one day, the girl’s slender arms were not able to support the weight of the sky any longer. The distance between the two grew considerably, so the girl laid down relieved.\n\nThe girl was exhausted, and fell into a deep sleep in the world she had created.\n\nAfter that, the girl's breath became the clouds and wind of this world. The world's violent gales are nothing more than the sounds of the girl's slightly more intense breathing. The girl's breathing became the world's thunder, and the alternating suns and moons are simply the girl using her curious eyes to observe every corner of her world. The four cardinal directions are the directions her limbs point, and the slightest movement from the girl would change the directions. The dirt on the ground is the dirt from the girl's skin; and the great rivers that people see are the channels formed from the places where the girl's hair fell. And finally, the girl's sweat turned into the world's rain and snow.\n\nThe girl is sleeping contently in the world she created, and the day she wakes again, her small world may feel her divine retribution."

We have analyzed all the content and found several articles that match the circumstances of our empire extremely well…At first, we suspected that some observer had written these articles on this forum privately, but we quickly rejected that supposition - because most of our observers are addicted to these articles. We are feeling strange about this because these articles are not that good, but we are captivated by them-especially those scenes of giantesses destroying heaven and earth, those powers that effortlessly destroy thousands of worlds…Although we can also achieve this level, when we look at these articles written by these little fellows, the feeling they bring is completely different."

The most terrifying thing was that §Y[event_target:gtsra_fleet_leader.GetName]§!, who was being tickled by this attack, subconsciously started rubbing her feet together, hoping that the itchiness would disappear unintentionally, and thus unknowingly turned our fleet, and the recovered resources, back into dirt on her feet."

The dispatched fleet attempted to contact her, but there was almost no response across the entire star system-when the probes discovered that she was in deep sleep, and that a giant sea of love fluid was floating beside her, everyone knew what had happened. As a giant girl, §Y[event_target:gtsra_fleet_leader.GetName]§! eliminated all her enemies with just one act of self-pleasure.

Your sidearm collapses like foam and piles up like blocks. Then, it transforms into a soft hand, a gentle hand that caresses your cheek. You look at the face before you, the face that you have called out in your dreams countless times, and are so surprised that you can't speak.\n\n“Miss me?” she winks at you mischievously. Then, she waves her hand like she is swatting a fly, and the dense enemy fleet in the sky is knocked away by a gigantic hand. The enemy is instantly reduced into powder, leaving behind no trace. You look towards the sky and see a blurry, gigantic face shrouding the entire sky. It is clearly the appearance of the beautiful woman in front of you.\n\n“Little Grey?” When you look down again, you find that you are already sitting in Little Grey’s hand.\n\n“I’m sorry, I was too greedy. I wanted all of your love, to the point that I was jealous of the effort and care you poured into your civilization. So, I wanted to test my position in your heart through a fake death. But I have now discovered that this comparison is pointless.\"\n\nYou discovered that the entire planet began to move toward the giant Little Grey in the sky, eventually stopping in front of her chest, like a necklace.\n\n“I’m sorry, my dear, please forgive my greed. Now you are all mine…” Little Grey began to explain somewhat apologetically, but your mind is not on that at all. Even if she is gigantic, so what? Even if she deceived you for a while, so what? You step forward and struggle to hug one of the fingers of the Little Grey on the ground. Yes, at least Greymist was really okay.\n\n“It’s wonderful, Greymist…You…you’re still alive…It’s so wonderful…” You are crying uncontrollably, while Little Grey is at a loss, gently and cautiously touching you in her hand."

  ###成长中的巨娘？（by sonatas）
  gts_growth_digsite: "Growing Giantess?"
  gts_growth_digsite_desc: "On this planet we discovered an archive hidden deep in the underground, which seems to contain some exciting information that may help us understand the celestial giantesses that appear in this universe."
  gts_evt_random.080001.name: "Hundredfold"
  gts_evt_random.080001.desc: "Can the people in the building see me~ I am the Dice Goddess~ Now my magnification is a hundred times yours. Little you aren't even as big as my finger. Let me touch you~\n\nAiya, why are you running? It's just my finger lightly touching the glass curtain wall. The entire sheet of glass shattered like a waterfall, falling down and smashing on the ground below the tall building. Whether it's you or the things you make, you are really weak!\n\nNext, my fingertip gently touches the top of the building and makes it sway. You inside the building are being bumped and tossed about like you're experiencing a magnitude 8 earthquake, as if you are about to fall to your deaths in the building. So pitiful~ Everyone must be strong! This way I can play with you for a bit longer. When I’m done playing with you, I’ll use my hundredfold size body to trample on your cities, as a long-awaited treat~"
  gts_evt_random.080002.name: "Thousandfold"
  gts_evt_random.080002.desc: "Two fair and smooth legs suddenly appeared in the city, and as it should be, those are my legs.\n\nIn your words, I’m now about a thousand times larger, which means that even the tallest buildings in the world are not even half of my height; I only need to lightly stretch out my feet, and my crystal-clear and round toes lightly tap onto the densely packed building complexes, and the tall buildings would collapse like dominoes.\n\nEven in front of a me that is a thousand times bigger, you are still so weak~"
  gts_evt_random.080003.name: "Ten Thousandfold"
  gts_evt_random.080003.desc: "Ten thousand times... I, who is ten thousand times bigger, look down at the endless complexes below me. Now, in my eyes, they are only the size of small stones.\n\nI lifted my foot and gently stepped down, and then the destruction began. The building complexes that took years to create were so vulnerable in front of me.\n\nThe dense high-rise buildings begin to collapse the moment they touched my sole. But my sole could not be stopped. It easily crushed the dense complexes into ruins several hundred meters deep.\n\nThen I moved my foot. The hundred-meter-high jade walls moved at a speed of thousands of kilometers per hour. The collisions of the high-rise buildings can at most give me some slight sensation before they are crushed and turn to ashes. The metropolis of the past has now been reduced to ruins.\n\nThis is me, at ten thousand times larger~ It’s probably the most commonly used size below giga?"
  gts_evt_random.080004.name: "Hundred Thousandfold"
  gts_evt_random.080004.desc: "Since ancient times, countless ancestors have had the idea of flying. They looked up at the world above their heads, fantasizing that one day they could also soar in the blue sky like flying birds.\n\nWhat adorable aspirations~ The blue sky that you dream of, for Miss A, who is a hundred thousand times bigger, is just the world below her legs.\n\nThe clouds that are several kilometers away, the clouds that you dream of touching, are just a thin mist for me. Whether it's moving my toes or lifting my foot, the cool feeling of the clouds clinging to my feet will give rise to a strong sense of superiority. Your aspirations are just toys that I can touch by moving my toes. The hormones I release due to my sense of superiority will spread along the stratosphere, spreading all over the world, right?\n\nIn the world of biology, if you accept someone’s hormones, it means you have submitted to them. Therefore, you, who are covered by my hormones, should start calling me a goddess from today on, right?"
  gts_evt_random.080005.name: "Billionfold"
  gts_evt_random.080005.desc: "Awu~ the tip of the cute little girl's tongue lightly licked past, and the moon, which has accompanied you for billions of years, transformed into debris and was drawn onto my tongue. The shattered rock layers and the lava attached to my tongue have a sweet, lava candy flavor; very comfortable-I am your Dice Goddess. Now, I am about a billion times bigger than you. The moon is just a small gumball to me, and your home planet can be held with just one hand!\n\nMy fingers are eight thousand eight hundred kilometers long; one finger can cover the Eurasian continent. Its height is also almost 2,000 kilometers, over two hundred times taller than your highest peak! Your atmosphere isn't even half that. Now, I'm not full yet, so why don't you become my snacks?"
  gts_evt_random.080006.name: "???-fold"
  gts_evt_random.080006.desc: "“So many planets; in front of my toes, they are only tiny specks of dust.” \n\nMiss A, who is one hundred and sixty thousand light-years tall, looks down at the sea of stars beneath her feet. Her fair, soft, and jade-like feet are now the tallest objects in the universe.\n\nHer sole gently steps down, rippling the starry river like water. Hundreds of millions of stars collide with the girl's toes and explode. Ripples that are enough to illuminate the entire universe appear in the starry river. But for the girl, they are still insignificant. After all, even at the speed of light, it would take 23,000 years to cross her foot from toe to arch-and the fragile explosions are nothing compared to such a giant foot.\n\nOccasionally, some lucky planets will be trapped by her footprints like dust and will become light dots that are nestled in the girl's lines. The lines on the girl’s foot, which are less than a millimeter wide, are a chasm for them that they could never fly out of even for billions of years. The girl might be smiling while watching them, watching their initial fear and despair, and their efforts to escape from this place. After generations of effort, they are just trying to escape from my own footprints. How adorable~"
  gts_from_footprint_digsite: "Remnants of an Ancient Civilization"
  gts_from_footprint_digsite_desc: "On this planet, there is a huge footprint left by a celestial giantess. Our scientists speculate that intelligent life may have once existed within this footprint."
  gts_evt_random.080011.name: "In-System Exploration - I"
  gts_evt_random.080011.desc: "A rocket carrying a satellite ascended slowly, emitting a plume of white smoke directly into space. Our civilization's satellite successfully deployed in orbit and established communication with the ground. It was then that we understood how tiny we are-humanity's entire history of warfare, from ancient times to the present, was nothing more than small skirmishes within the lines of a toe print. The areas where hundreds of millions of people live cannot even fill half of a big toe print. The 'ocean' where steel ships sail is just a puddle formed by the sweat collected from her big toe. Outside the mountains on the edge of the footprint is an endless expanse of white snow. In other words, the reason why human civilization has not been swallowed up by this snow sea and ice mountains is because the goddess's footprint has been protecting us. To put it another way, we humans are no more than insects that propagate and live inside the goddess's footprint..."
  gts_evt_random.080012.name: "In-System Exploration - II"
  gts_evt_random.080012.desc: "After launching the satellite, the space agency was intensely preparing a lunar landing plan. Several years later, another rocket was launched into space. A landing module slowly descended onto the surface of the moon. Our astronauts stepped out of the module, taking one small step-which was also a huge leap for the world. The return module brought us lunar surface soil, but scientists discovered goddess body fluids in the lunar soil composition. That is to say, the goddess had long since played with this poor satellite."
  gts_evt_random.080013.name: "In-System Exploration - III"
  gts_evt_random.080013.desc: "The Mars rover traversed a group of strange trenches-these trenches were deep and winding, seemingly chaotic, yet very regular. At the end of a straight line is a sharp angle. A smooth circular arc is connected to another straight line. The neat design caused people to contemplate the Latin letters on Earth.\n\n'A P L O G' is the shape of the deep trenches on the surface of Mars. Our researchers also found goddess body fluid on the surface of Mars, and goddess sweat on the walls of the trenches. Some speculate that these traces were marks created by the goddess's fingers, and 'APLOG' may be the goddess's name."
  gts_evt_random.080014.name: "Entering the Space Age"
  gts_evt_random.080014.desc: "In recent years, with increasing pollution and global warming, the increasingly pungent foot odor remaining in the goddess’s footprint has become a major factor hindering the development of civilization. Our people's calls for a more habitable planet are growing increasingly louder. However, looking at the entire home system, the sister planets, which were scarred and covered with goddess body fluids as well as the asteroids that were torn apart after being toyed with, clearly cannot be called habitable planets. For the needs of civilization's development, we have to look for hope outside the star system. Giant ships filled with pioneers have set sail. They will go to the unknown outside star systems and seek the future for our civilization."
  gts_evt_random.080015.name: "Extraterrestrial Discoveries - I"
  gts_evt_random.080015.desc: "The extraterrestrial exploration team discovered more planets with goddess traces in this star system, but one of the planets was compressed into the shape of an apple core, and was stationary inside the system. Judging by the faint milky scent contained in the atmosphere, and the level of compression, it is without a doubt that the goddess's breasts are huge. This startling news ended the debate about the goddess's bust size. It made our people cheer. The whole nation was filled with an air of joy."
  gts_evt_random.080016.name: "Extraterrestrial Discoveries - II"
  gts_evt_random.080016.desc: "The extraterrestrial exploration team discovered another planet in an outside star system that has been trampled on by the goddess. And there was life inside the footprint as well! But the trampling force on this planet was clearly deeper than on the home planet. The towering mountains divided and surrounded each toe print, and even aircraft could not cross them. The continuous mountain ranges formed by the pressing of the sole's patterns resulted in civilizations that were cut off from communication from each other. The civilizations which lacked communication became stagnant. The highest level of technology that these civilizations have thus far are still hovering in the Middle Ages.\n\nBecause the concentration of foot odor here is even more pungent than on our home system, we gave up the idea of colonizing here. After capturing some of the local residents for research purposes, we continued our exploration of star systems outside the home system."
  gts_evt_random.080017.name: "Extraterrestrial Discoveries - Final"
  gts_evt_random.080017.desc: "In the past, from various traces, we have inferred that there is a giant being in this universe that we call the goddess. Her traces can be found in every star system. No one knows her face. But today, we saw the goddess herself with our own eyes.  When the extraterrestrial exploration team arrived at the new star system, the team were horrified to see a black furry catgirl as huge as a planet was playing with a tiny planet with her sole. After secretly sending a research ship to analyze her, we discovered that her information and data were completely consistent with the goddess's data. That is to say, the goddess who created us is this black furry catgirl who is frolicking with planets like a beast.\n\nThe panicked exploration team decided to leave this star system without being detected. But the goddess had already sensed our presence. She let go of the pitiful planet that had been rubbed into a foot-grime planet, and reached out to grab the spaceship in her hand. She licked her lips, and looked at the exploration team with great interest. Her emerald green eyes scanned everyone on the ship, and her aura made people kneel uncontrollably. After we nervously stated our identities, she was surprised that a high-level civilization capable of interstellar travel had emerged in her footprint, and that they even saw her as a deity. The goddess gazed at the exploration team like she was gazing at her own children. The pressure from earlier disappeared completely. As a reward, the goddess agreed to shrink us all and relocate us into a strip-shaped pendant in her cleavage, traveling with her throughout this universe."

 # 嘶吼的殖民飞船引擎声第一次刺破了这颗星球带着薄雾的清晨，伴随着沉闷的一声震动，飞船成为了殖民者们的新家，尽管搭载着工程机械和农牧业作物禽畜的殖民飞船长达数公里，但是在我们的巨娘看来不过是普通的长途客车而已，伴随着舱门缓缓升起，兴奋的巨娘乘客们早已按捺不住激动的心情，争先恐后地踏上这片处女大地，而装卸货物这种枯燥的工作，理所当然的留给了随行的小人仆从们\n\n巨娘们开心地用靴子踏平森林，然后在嬉戏中吓得本地野兽落荒而逃……随着巨娘间打闹越来越激烈，带着浓烈气味的胖次和鞋袜变成了星球上四散的新地标，而甜蜜的爱液混入本地河流，让淡水散发出带有催情气息的腥味，直到几天后我们的巨娘因为在空旷的大地上，已经没什么可玩的时候，她们才返回飞船，来玩弄下小人仆从们所搭建的新社区，一些简易而矮小的定居点已经在飞船周边扩张开来，推土机和吊车正有条不紊的开展着工作\n\n一位赤足的巨娘——她的靴子早就被同伴们当作水瓶用了——正准备穿过棚户区回到飞船，看着那些凌乱的工棚，她直接一脚踩了进去……
 gts_evt_random.010260.desc:0 "The roaring engine of the colony ship pierced the misty morning of this planet for the first time. With a dull thud, the ship became the new home for the colonists. Although the colony ship, loaded with engineering machinery and agricultural livestock, was kilometers long, it was nothing more than a long-distance bus to our Giantesses. As the hatch slowly rose, the excited Giantess passengers could no longer hold back their excitement and scrambled to step on this virgin land. The boring work of loading and unloading cargo was naturally left to the accompanying small folk servants.\n\nThe Giantesses happily trampled the forest with their boots, scaring the local beasts into fleeing... As the play between Giantesses became more intense, strong-smelling panties and socks became new landmarks scattered on the planet, and sweet love juice mixed into local rivers, making the fresh water emit a fishy smell with aphrodisiac scent. It wasn't until a few days later, when our Giantesses had nothing left to play with on the empty land, that they returned to the ship to play with the new community built by small folk servants. Simple and low settlements had expanded around the ship, and bulldozers and cranes were working in an orderly manner.\n\nA barefoot Giantess—her boots had long been used as water bottles by her companions—was about to cross the shantytown to return to the ship. Looking at those messy sheds, she stepped directly into them..."

 gts_evt_random.010261.desc:0 "§R Hmph aaaaaah! §!\n\nUnlike those fragile small folk buildings in the past, a shed was exceptionally sturdy. It didn't move even after withstanding tens of thousands of tons of Giantess trampling. The reason was that this hut was modified from a Giantess building block toy called 'LeG', made of nanomaterials in one piece, strong enough to withstand Giantess's casual play. The barefoot Giantess let out an explosive roar. 'Explosive' here is physical, not just descriptive. Hundreds of small folk within a kilometer were directly shocked into imploding into meat chunks, while those further away bled from orifices, losing hearing, vision, or even intelligence for life. However, a surveillance camera ten kilometers away recorded this shocking scene... This was originally just an insignificant episode in the first colonization, until a busybody edited the Giantess's voice into a meme song on the forum:\n\n'§S Attention everyone, this planet, this universe, is our Giantess big enough?\nFrom Cadia~~ to Mordia! Calida, and Corellia! Avatar, here we come! Aurora~~ and Von Braun... Oh Gaia, Terra, and Holy Terra! Agrippina, go to Yuuzhan Vong!

Just this small movement triggered a milk tide! Accumulated milk gushed out from the nipple like a dam burst, forming a surging white flood. Our fleet was instantly swallowed by this fragrant and deadly wave, submerged along with the wreckage they tried to recover. All recovered resources were lost, and the fleet was almost wiped out."
 # §R"舰队大胆地驶入了那片深邃、充满乳香的乳沟峡谷"§!\n初始的收获极为丰厚，巨大的金属残块被轻易拖拽而出。然而，随着逐渐深入，环境变得愈发复杂湿滑。 §Y[event_target:gtsra_fleet_leader.GetName]§!无意识地并拢了一下双臂，刹那间，两侧巨大的肉色山壁（乳肉）温和却不可抗拒地合拢，巨大的压力瞬间袭来，舰队连同刚刚到手的宝贵资源一同被深深地挤压、包裹进那温暖而极具弹性的深渊之中，瞬间将数艘深入最内部的船舰挤压成了金属薄片，与敌舰残骸再无分别。后方的船舰惊慌失措试图后撤，却导致更多舰船在狭窄湿润的肉谷中发生碰撞，最终迷失在这片柔软的死亡迷宫之中。通讯频道里最后传来的只有金属被挤压变形的刺耳声响和队员们短促惊呼，随后便彻底失去了信号。仅有少数在外围作业的船舰得以逃脱，带回了有限的战利品和同伴被碾碎的噩耗

In an instant, the huge flesh-colored mountain walls (breast flesh) on both sides closed gently but irresistibly. Huge pressure struck instantly, squeezing and wrapping the fleet along with the precious resources just obtained into that warm and elastic abyss. Instantly, several ships deep inside were crushed into metal sheets, no different from enemy wreckage. The ships in the rear panicked and tried to retreat, causing more collisions in the narrow and moist valley of flesh, eventually getting lost in this soft labyrinth of death. The last sound from the communication channel was the ear-piercing sound of metal deformation and the short screams of crew members, followed by complete signal loss. Only a few ships working on the periphery escaped, bringing back limited spoils and the bad news of their companions being crushed."

 gts_evt_random.070025.desc:0 "We decided not to send a tiny fleet to disturb §Y[event_target:gtsra_fleet_leader.GetName]§!'s rest, but let her handle these battle traces herself. When she woke up, she lazily opened her eyes, glanced at the eyesores 'small particles' on her chest, then raised the corner of her mouth, seeming to have a great idea. She stretched out her jade hand capable of crushing stars, and casually grabbed a huge gas giant from nearby. This planet was just right in size and texture for her, like a soft bath sponge. She gently pressed the gas giant between her magnificent breasts and wiped back and forth. The gaseous shell of the planet fully mixed and rubbed with the warship metal, star debris, and crystal sweat remaining on her skin, emitting a deep and grand cosmic roar.
