The liquid corroded our mechanical arm instantly! It's soft, not rock!'\n\n'What place is this? Return immediately!'\n\n'The area above is sealed in red acid!'\n\n'Looks like we're inside something's stomach... Hit the bottom, our hull is tested for this. Descend...'\n\n(Splash)\n\n--- End Of Transmission ---\n\nThough the attempt failed, we know there's more underground life here."

  gts_traptrix.320.name: "Rising Disappearance Cases"
