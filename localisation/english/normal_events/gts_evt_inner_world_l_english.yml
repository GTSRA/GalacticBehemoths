  inner_world: "Stellar Disk"
  inner_world_desc: "This planet conceals a mysterious and incomprehensible device, which will draw significant research resources for its study. Security and defense work on this planet will be prioritized at the highest level."
  d_gts_inner_sol: "Stars"
  d_gts_inner_sol_desc: "The energy emitted by countless stars within the stellar disk is just enough to charge our researchers' handheld devices.\nNote: Avoid extended overcharging. This behavior rapidly depletes the stellar disk's total energy, potentially causing temperature drops that could interfere with observational data."
  d_gts_inner_hole: "Black Hole"
  d_gts_inner_hole_desc: "Despite attempts to capture and crush the black holes within the stellar disk to release a large amount of dark matter at once, for the stability of the stellar disk universe, we ultimately chose to slowly absorb minute quantities of dark matter from these black holes."
  d_gts_inner_scan: "Great Fissure"
  d_gts_inner_scan_desc: "Archaeologists have left handprints and butt prints on the stellar disk, which will take considerable time to repair. Since these marked planets and empires have turned to dust and are of no observational value, we can extract the material for its final use."
  d_gts_inner_aninmal: "Celestial Beasts"
  d_gts_inner_aninmal_desc: "The 'giant beasts' that intimidate tinies can sometimes be pulled from the stellar disk for an overtime snack.\nNote: Though the Aether Dragon shell is tasty, don't go overboard; if they go extinct, you'll have to eat real Aether Dragons!"
  d_gts_inner_a_empire: "Fallen Empire"
  d_gts_inner_a_empire_desc: "These civilizations exhibit traits similar to fallen empires in our universe: powerful and arrogant. While we can easily obliterate their vast territories and formidable fleets, it's more meaningful to learn undiscovered technologies by observing their actions."
  d_gts_inner_b_empire: "Standard Empire"
  d_gts_inner_b_empire_desc: "These civilizations resemble our younger, newly spacefaring neighbors. Observing their development can offer insights into our current challenges. Moderate intervention is permitted to ensure their early demise is prevented."
  d_gts_inner_c_empire: "Indigenous Planets"
  d_gts_inner_c_empire_desc: "These civilizations remain rather primitive, and due to their diminutive size, only some feudal and above indigenous planets can be barely located. Their protection standards are minimal, allowing various experiments that ensure the survival of major civilizations.\nNote: Permission for experiments doesn’t mean reckless play; strict action will be taken if planets are found encapsulated and consumed!"
  system_inner_world: "Lindou"
  planet_inner_world: "Dream Continuation"
  gts_inner_world_category: "Great Void"
  gts_inner_world_desc: "Scans indicate an anomalous large cavity beneath the sands of this planet."
  gts_ring_world_category: "Double Ring World"
  gts_ring_world_category_desc: "The construction of this ring world differs significantly from conventional ring worlds, with tens of thousands of years separating the construction of its outer and inner layers."
  gts_evt_inner_world.1.name: "The Great Void"
  gts_evt_inner_world.1.desc: "Preliminary investigations reveal significant anti-air defense ruins on the surface, suggesting hidden secrets. Drilling and expedition teams will split to find a pathway into the underground."
  site_gts_inner_world: "Inner World"
  site_gts_inner_world_desc: "In the subterranean passages, countless faint lights dot the endless darkness."
  gts_evt_inner_world.2.name: "Darkness"
  gts_evt_inner_world.2.desc: "Our expedition has found an entrance to the underground cavity!\n\nAfter futile searches, luckily, our scientific team found a narrow opening at the bottom of a large basin after a sandstorm. Diving ten minutes underwater, the team reached the cavity.\n\nA technology we don't understand has protected this space from geological collapse for hundreds of thousands of years, disabling our modern lighting and communication equipment. The team must use spare lamps to cautiously explore this dimly glowing space.\n\nThe drilling team will arrive at a suitable site in days to alleviate this electromagnetic disturbance."
  gts_evt_inner_world.2.a: "Hope all goes well"
  gts_evt_inner_world.3.name: "Turn on the Lights"
  gts_evt_inner_world.3.desc: "A field that withstands geological forces isn't something we can breach lightly. Our drilling efforts couldn’t open this formidable shield.\n\nMeanwhile, team members on the site groped around, looking for power switches in the dim light. Despite tough challenges, they found the control panel for this space's lights. Though electromagnetic interference persists and the lights are dimly hidden, our team can finally start work."
  gts_evt_inner_world.3.a: "Great, continue the investigation"
  gts_evt_inner_world.4.name: "Stellar Disk"
  gts_evt_inner_world.4.desc: "The investigation results are shocking. The entire underground space shows no signs of man-made alteration but a luxurious large round table in the middle. Embedded on its surface is a concave stellar disk displaying minuscule galaxies we almost swept away as dust.\n\nAccidentally sitting on the stellar disk while searching for switches, team members left gigantic hand and butt imprints. The effects of these disruptions-like microorganisms and fluids from team members-on the development of inner universe civilizations are unknown.\n\nThe shape of star clusters in the stellar disk doesn't exactly match our galaxy, leading uncertainty if it's a depiction of our galaxy at some point or of a distant star cluster. It's also uncertain if this micro-universe affects our reality.\n\nWe strongly recommend sealing all archaeological data and implementing the highest lockdown and research isolation on this planet."
  gts_evt_inner_world.4.a: "Incredible..."
