  # Event Chains/Anomalies/Special Projects/Points of Interest
  gts_kitsunes_ling_sleeping_desc: "This is a colossal creature beyond our imagination- even the term 'colossal' doesn't fully capture the shock experienced by our front-line scientists. Its size is astronomical, nearly ten times the diameter of smaller planets.\nOur scientists can't comprehend how such a being exists without collapsing under its own gravity, or how it can move when it's so massive.\nIt's identifiable as a living being due to its fox-like features, showing it's definitely not inanimate.\nFor now, it seems dormant. Further study of this cosmic-sized curled up sleeping entity is advised."

  gts_kitsune_ling_chain_title: "Tales of the Cosmic Kitsune - Part Two"
  gts_kitsune_ling_chain_desc: "A nondescript giant celestial body in the Spirit Fox Cradle system immediately caught our attention. It's unimaginably colossal… could it be a creature? It far exceeds the size of a planet, leaving an unparalleled impact."

  # Revelations
  gts_kitsune_ling_revelations_from_celestial: "Revelations from the Celestial Fox"

  gts_kitsune_ling_revelations_from_celestial_desc: "The sighting of a fox as large as a star amidst the stars shocked the Empire while simultaneously enhancing our enthusiasm for sociological research."
  # Initial Event
  gts_kitsune_ling.10.name: "An Unmissable Celestial Body or a Creature?"
  gts_kitsune_ling.10.desc: "Upon entering [From.GetStarName], Science Officer [This.GetLeaderName] immediately spotted an enormous celestial body. It seems unimaginably vast, far greater than a planet, and [This.GetLeaderName] strongly demands further investigation."

  gts_kitsune_ling.10.ok: "Incredible."
  gts_kitsune_ling.20.name: "Kitsune Embracing a Giant Planet"
  gts_kitsune_ling.20.desc: "The preliminary investigation of this celestial kitsune (named for its appearance) is complete. Given its size, its gravity exceeds that of a regular planet greatly, yet it maintains a sleek, elongated form hinting at unfathomable strength. Additionally, if such a creature could move, its energy used would far surpass our strongest weapons-the body's strength is mind-boggling.\nRemote sensing shows no signs of movement from this celestial entity; its eyes, kilometers in diameter, are tightly shut, and it is motionless, ignoring our research ship entirely."
  gts_kitsune_ling.20.a: "We must research her closely."
  gts_kitsune_ling.20.b: "We'll conduct safer research from afar."

  gts_kitsune_ling.20.c: "A terrifying creature, keep away!"
  gts_kitsune_ling.100.name: "Kitsune's Contact Strategy"
  gts_kitsune_ling.100.desc: "Remote scanning shows no activity from the Kitsune embracing the planet; its eyes, massive kilometers across, shut tightly, completely motionless, ignoring our research ship. Scientists proposed various exploration strategies, one involving probing through its bodily gaps-which, to us, are vast chasms hundreds of kilometers wide. Or caution dictates only surveying its perimeter."
  gts_kitsune_ling.100.a: "Explore through its physical crevices."

  gts_kitsune_ling.100.b: "Don't take excessive risks, just surface surveys."
  gts_kitsune_ling.190.name: "Close Call"
  gts_kitsune_ling.190.desc: "Our exploration team attempted to probe inside this celestial giant. With specialized high-thrust ships, they ignored the self-generated gravity, entered through what seem like ears, and scanned deeply, but reached an impasse after several thousand kilometers of twisted paths. Inside, gravity seems strangely directed towards her body, its cause baffling scientists. No oddities on the surface or ear canal-no conspicuous dirt.\n\nProving her body hasn't visibly enlarged due to folds, just snowy, soft lands, the team moved forward. Ships moved past closed mouths towards a crevice between the legs, sensors showed the gap allowing entry-the void tens of thousands of meters represents nothing to the being itself.\nInside, misty gas stirred, seemingly noncorrosive. Instruments found mainly steam, oxygen, nitrogen, and other unknown substances-non-toxic. Eliminating these, the remainder almost matches an inhabitable planet's makeup. Bold explorers fantasize about establishing a colony here.\nSome even exposed themselves unprotected to the air-duly prepared yet surprisingly unharmed. A faint fragrance fills the atmosphere; though slightly different from home, it's breathable. They feel slight rejuvenation physically and mentally.\n\nUltimately, emboldened explorers land inside. Nothing significant on the soft, moist surface, but suddenly a translucent sphere, hundreds of meters large, approached rapidly, causing alarm."
  gts_kitsune_ling.190.desc.escaped: "$gts_kitsune_ling.190.desc$\nLast-minute, the team returned to ships, liftoff succeeded before contact, concluding this exploration."
  gts_kitsune_ling.190.desc.escaped.psy: "$gts_kitsune_ling.190.desc.escaped$\nPost-exit, some reported sensing psychic waves. Investigating further through the void is advised."
  gts_kitsune_ling.190.a: "Phew... at least the crew's safe."

  gts_kitsune_ling.190.b: "Checking the void might yield answers."
  gts_kitsune_ling.192.name: "Narrow Escape"
  gts_kitsune_ling.192.desc.injured: "$gts_kitsune_ling.190.desc$\nThe team returns roughly, engine launch delayed, the sphere brushed the ship, melting touched sections instantly, causing structural damage. The ship launched, but abrupt takeoffs send crew sprawling, Chief Scientst [From.GetLeaderName] hit by a collapsing beam, sustaining injuries."
  gts_kitsune_ling.192.desc.injured.psy: "$gts_kitsune_ling.192.desc.injured$\nHastily departing, survivors reported psychic waves sensed from it, suggesting exploring by the void."

  gts_kitsune_ling.192.a: "Ah... that fox is terrifying."
  gts_kitsune_ling.195.name: "Strange Journey"
  gts_kitsune_ling.195.desc: "Cautiously, the team only landed on its surface. They found nothing significant, not even dirt.\nThis creature's inactivity, yet unique formation, promises fruitful studies scientifically and biologically."
  gts_kitsune_ling.195.desc.psy: "$gts_kitsune_ling.195.desc$\nOn its body, some report psychic waves sensed, advising exploration through the void."

  gts_kitsune_ling.195.a: "Fascinating."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.name: "Fox of the Void"
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc: "The consciousness of this celestial entity is vast and unending-its scale seemingly surpasses even its enormous form. The void itself feels like a toy to its mind-a mere facet.\nRegardless, we've confirmed: this creature's consciousness doesn't seem to reside in this realm, but we glimpse part of its tendrils extending here.\n[From.GetLeaderName] attempts a high-security psychic ritual near it, aiming to contact its consciousness. Extreme caution is required-such a massive consciousness sea can easily engulf any mind daring to venture."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc.success: "$gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc$\nContact wasn't successful-the gap in consciousness is vast-but [From.GetLeaderName] ingeniously formed a new psychic barrier amidst turmoil, safely exiting the ritual before safeguards completely failed. The experience broadened our scientific approach and inspired [From.GetLeaderName]."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc.escaped: "$gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc$\nNarrow escape for [From.GetLeaderName], who rapidly devised a new psychic barricade during crises. Although weaker than anticipated, it secured an exit before total failure, leading to newfound scientific insights."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc.failed: "$gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc$\n[From.GetLeaderName] suffered severe damage! Confronted by a consciousness more formidable than anything in the void, undetected yet mild, but the shock devastated our scientist. Hastily constructed barriers failed to assist; barely escaped from the aftermath, the consciousness wave was surprisingly weak."

  gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc.failed.mia: "$gts_kitsune_ling.200.desc$\n[From.GetLeaderName] vanished from sensors, overwhelmed by the void-sized consciousness. Though undetected, the gentle activity profoundly injured our scientist, without effective barriers [From.GetLeaderName] faced an unknown fate, absorbed into its consciousness."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.a: "Incredible luck."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.b: "A close call, but it turned out well."
  gts_kitsune_ling.200.c: "Fortunate there weren't larger consequences."

  gts_kitsune_ling.200.d: "Praying for her safety."
  # TXT_GTS_FOX_LING_CONTACT_LAUNCH
  # We've succeeded! Though the reason for the celestial entity's sudden awakening is unclear, we deciphered its language. It's transmitting strange, unknowable waves, now decoded. We've established contact with the nine-tailed fox.
