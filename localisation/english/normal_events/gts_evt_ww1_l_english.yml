  NAME_Eliza: "Eliza"
  gts_anomaly_ww1_category: "Trench-ridden Land"
  gts_anomaly_ww1_category_desc: "We observed extensive trenches across the continent and a gigantic humanoid mechanical life form on this planet."
  gts_evt_ww.1.name: "Research Complete"
  gts_evt_ww.1.desc: "After multiple attempts, we confirmed communicability with this humanoid mechanical life form, and have now established official contact."
  gts_evt_ww.2.desc: "\"Greetings,\" the large mechanical maid girl greeted us. \"I represent the Holy Britannian Empire Government and the Tudor Royal Family in greeting you.\""
  gts_evt_ww.2.a: "Please, tell me about yourself."
  gts_evt_ww.2.a.response: "\"Me?\" She puffed out her chest and proudly said, \"It is my honor to introduce myself to you as the pinnacle of Imperial technological prosperity, a steam-powered service giant robot, code-named 'Eliza,' serial number GBR0002.\n\nAdditionally, let me introduce my sisters, my elder sister, the administrative giant robot 'Virginia,' and my younger sister, the maritime giant robot 'Dreadnought.' But...\"\n\nShe looked slightly dejected.\n\n\"They and those nameless children have long ceased functioning.\""
  gts_evt_ww.2.b: "What is this Holy whatnot Empire you mentioned?"
  gts_evt_ww.2.b.response: "\"The Holy Britannian Empire. The full name is 'The Holy Britannian and Frankonian United Empire and the Northern Columbian, Australiandian, Africandian, and Indiannian Crown Territories.' It's quite a mouthful, right? Each part of the name represents our nation's glorious history of dominion over seas and world conquest, though many titles were undeserved...\"\n\nShe paused, then continued:\n\n\"But in the face of your esteemed nation, which uses entire planets as colonies and constellations as administrative zones, our vast territory seems trivial. If my creators were still around, they would undoubtedly be extremely curious and respectful of your world.\""
  gts_evt_ww.2.c: "Why are there so many trenches here?"
  gts_evt_ww.3.desc: "\"Because of war.\"\n\n\"I do not know the warfare tactics of your country, but here, the warring sides dug numerous trenches at the front lines and coordinated charges with artillery to seize the enemy trenches. The country we fought against was a rising empire vying with us for world dominance, and years of covert rivalry eventually escalated into total war.\n\nAt first, both countries adhered to war rules, even ceasing fire during joint holidays. We were tasked with transporting personnel and supplies to the rear and occasionally digging trenches at the front. But as years passed and war dragged on, impatience grew. My sister could always hear the incessant arguing in the Imperial Parliament when passing the capital, while my younger sister frequently encountered mentally deranged soldiers inhaling gas, risking being crushed by her as they pleaded to be taken home.\n\nLater, we were instructed to the front, not to save the wounded but to slaughter the enemy in their trenches. Besides us three, the Empire repurposed many in-construction giant robots for military use during the war. As the front's demands increased, these children were no longer equipped with our advanced emotion simulators and communication modules, obeying only to crush enemy fortresses and flatten enemy soldiers with their trenches until destroyed by enemy heavy guns and bombs. Maintenance procedures were greatly simplified; many children bore only numbers until they perished...\"\n\nShe looked quite distressed,\n\n\"My creators once declared this to be the war to end all wars, but looking back, this war truly ended everything.\""
  gts_evt_ww.3.a: "So was it war that destroyed this world?"
  gts_evt_ww.4.desc: "\"No... but in a way, yes.\"\n\n\"In the war's final year, a border town experienced a plague, initially affecting only a small area, but the virus soon spread globally via supply and troop transport ships. Already harsh frontline conditions turned into hell on earth when the plague hit. We three were finally relieved from those terrible slaughter missions-others had already taken our place. Our task was merely to carefully extract the countless corpses of young and middle-aged men from the trenches and take them back to be buried.\"\n\n\"Finally, the war ended, as the enemy soldiers couldn't bear the pressure anymore, erupting in mass mutiny, leading to a hasty peace treaty and our victory.\"\n\n\"But if humanity no longer exists, what meaning does victory hold? The military demobilization triggered another wave of plague while the government, overwhelmed, ignored territorial concessions.\"\n\n\"We thought our creators were great, but before nature, they were fragile. The world war, efficient as a machine in killing lives, paled compared to the apocalyptic plague. Ultimately, as you see, this world fell into serene peace.\"\n\n\"Without orders, those military giant robots started wandering aimlessly, sometimes entering cities, trampling markets, parliaments, factories, residences, theaters, stations empty. We wanted to stop them, but being non-military robots, we were powerless against these children. Thankfully, within years, their wear-and-tear became extreme, and they collapsed on their own. These hastily made things had terribly short design lifespans.\"\n\n\"Later, my sisters also left me. The younger sister was damaged by a mine when attacking a harbor during the war, causing her steam system to become unstable. At dusk, she ceased functioning. Later, my elder sister also... I... I had to shut down her operational program myself...\"\n\nLong after, she resumed speaking: \"Sorry, lost my composure. At that time, I thought I was going insane, but I didn't. Don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but I retained my sanity, maintaining the rusting cross-sea bridge, the slowly submerging harbor, the aging cityscape day by day... Then I realized I could do nothing more, lying in the once-bloodiest Verdun trench, awaiting the day my steam heart stops, letting death reunite me with them.\""
  gts_evt_ww.4.a: "Would you like to join us? We can offer you a new life."
  gts_evt_ww.4.a.response: "Silent for a long time, she gradually eased out of her melancholy:\n\n\"Thank you very much for your kindness. Since my once-loyal nation no longer exists, I don't mind using my knowledge to benefit more lives, sparing them from war and disease. But I sincerely request of you, please reserve a piece of territory for the civilization that created me. They might have committed unforgivable sins, but their stories shouldn't be forgotten, which would also be a comfort to my sisters.\""
  gts_evt_ww.4.b: "A poor soul burdened with sin, let's give her release."
  gts_evt_ww.4.b.response: "\"Thank you, thank you. I can finally reunite with my sisters and my homeland. May your nation enjoy everlasting peace.\""
  gts_evt_ww.5.name: "Space Pioneer"
  gts_evt_ww.5.desc: "Though hard to believe, upon closer examination, our scientists and historians confirmed this to be one of the manned research ships launched early in our space era. The ship reached billions of years ago after a highly risky temporal fold, instantly captured and swallowed by a galaxy-sized female humanoid. With all escape attempts failing, the scientists aboard began recording and preserving as much data on the giantess's body structure and internal environment as possible until swallowed by acidic seas."
  gts_evt_ww.5.a: "Recover the research shipwreck; we must honor these heroes by bringing them home."
  gts_evt_ww.5.b: "We can't let their efforts go to waste, download all available data."
  eliza_insight: "Eliza's Insight"
  eliza_insight_desc: "Research into this steam-era intelligent robot has provided significant insights into our robotics technology."
