  gts_evt_ancient.11.desc: "By collecting fossils and conducting dating research, we learned that this species belongs to a mollusk, about 3-4 meters tall, that was active 12 million years ago. This civilization was highly advanced in technology, with their computer and virtual reality technologies being far ahead of their time.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that, apart from the parts that have decayed over time, there are many traces of deliberate destruction among the ruins of the Wotaomu cities. It seems that at the end of this civilization, this species began to destroy their cities and commit group suicide."
  gts_evt_ancient.12.name: "Investigation"
  gts_evt_ancient.12.desc: "Sure enough, we found observation records about the stellar-level girl in a relatively well-preserved archive, which convinced us that this girl has an extremely long lifespan or is capable of time travel.\n\nAbout 12 million years ago, this giant girl suddenly appeared at the hyperlane entry point of this star system and slowly moved towards the other exit.\n\nDue to surprise, the Wotaomu fleet only hurriedly left her path after a ship was crushed.\n\nAfter confirming that communication was impossible and that she was not hostile for the time being, ground research centers and research vessels began to scan her remotely, and the results were surprising.\n\nMany of the test data seems to be fabricated, and if it wasn't for the fact that this creature could easily crush planets with her breath and the invisible pressure of her heartbeat, they simply wouldn't believe that this was an organic life form.\n\nAfter that, some daring scientists began to try to land for close-range scans. After the message of a safe landing arrived, more and more scientists began to request close-range or landing observations. Plans to build megastructures to conduct systematic inspections using this valuable opportunity were also put on the agenda."
  gts_evt_ancient.13.name: "Follow-Up"
  gts_evt_ancient.13.desc: "After arguing for a long time about the site selection, the Wotaomu leader finally approved the construction of a large collection station outside the gravitational field of the girl's foot to collect skin samples for detailed analysis, and an array of detection arrays surrounding several of her hairs to detect her whereabouts.\n\nAfter review and approval, a total of forty-six expedition teams were authorized to enter the girl's body through multiple entrances for exploration.\n\nThe collection work of the collecting station was progressing very slowly. In order to carve marks in the foot pattern, the Wotaomu even used planet-destroying weapons, regardless of the ecological damage it would cause to the star system, and finally collected a piece of skin that was as tall as a person, and it was collected as if it had been instructed to shed it for them to collect, and no further collection attempts were successful.\n\nThis piece of skin was constantly releasing an indescribable power, and the space around it was also distorted, and even many physical laws stopped working within the affected area.\n\nSeveral expedition teams returned in time after a few weeks of exploration, bringing back valuable test data. These data further confirmed that this was indeed just an ordinary organic life, but for some reason that they could not understand, this creature became so huge and able to cause various strange natural phenomena.\n\nMore teams, however, were crushed, squeezed, and absorbed by the unconscious activity of the girl's body. By the time the girl left the star system, several investigation teams that had insisted on going deep were still out of contact, completely lost in the girl's star-system-sized body."
  gts_evt_ancient.14.name: "End"
  gts_evt_ancient.14.desc: "After leaving this star system, the giant girl was no longer heard from, and the detection array deployed on the girl's hair instantly lost contact. They could only assume that she had gone to a star system that was even undetectable to them.\n\nAfter combining this experience with their unique understanding of the essence of the universe, they began to believe that the universe they lived in was virtual, and that the world where the giant creature was located was real, and the outbreak of this ideology had a great impact on the culture and philosophy of the Wotaomu.\n\nAccording to the last record we found, they began to use the piece of skin they had labored to collect from the giant girl along with the large amount of data they had recorded to develop a device called \"Reality Perforation Instrument\" in order to explore the \"real world\".\n\nWhether they succeeded in development and what their fate was afterwards, we don't know. However, their interesting views on the universe have inspired our scientists a lot."

  gts_evt_ancient.21.name: "Preliminary Investigation"
  gts_evt_ancient.21.desc: "Existing data can only prove that the Zeluo race was a species with powerful psionic talents. Furthermore, it seems that the Zeluo experienced a civil war at the end of their civilization due to a violent conflict over their foreign policy, which directly led to the destruction of their nation.\n\nTheir battles, which affected most of the galaxy, avoided this planet, and all the signs indicate that this planet does not seem to have been abandoned due to natural disasters or wars. The reason is still awaiting our further investigation.\n\nIn addition, we also found a large amount of dark purple powdered dust in the air of the Zeluo settlement, which is an extremely rare aerosol among exotic particles. Initial identification indicates that it has a certain addictive nature and can enhance psionic powers."
  gts_evt_ancient.22.name: "The Shroud"
  gts_evt_ancient.22.desc: "In the center of the planet's building complex, we discovered a large crystal. For some inexplicable reason, we couldn't help but think that this crystal wanted to be discovered and communicated with by us. However, we tried various methods and were unable to crack its encryption system.\n\nFinally, an investigator took the risk of inhaling a large amount of Zeluo powder, subsequently falling into a coma and waking up after several days of treatment.\n\nAfter waking up, she told us that during her coma, she entered an anomalous dimension called \"The Shroud\", where she saw many incredible things, such as spherical universes the size of an apple where each living being inside was clearly visible. In the end, she discovered the psionic crystal but was ejected the moment she tried to touch it.\n\nAt first, the investigation team did not take it seriously, thinking it was just a hallucination caused by inhaling too much hallucinogenic dust. However, further research on this dust and the attempts of more people gradually proved that what she said was true.\n\nAccording to the test subjects, this crystal is a psionic archive. In order to strictly prevent other species from hacking it, only the Zeluo race could access it. It seems that we can temporarily gain access to the Shroud and the psionic crystal by inhaling Zeluo powder.\n\nAfter collecting enough Zeluo powder, we will begin the first formal access to the psionic crystal in a few days."
  gts_evt_ancient.23.name: "Exploring the Shroud"
  gts_evt_ancient.23.desc: "Our attempts were successful!\n\nThanks to sufficient reserves of Zeluo powder, we finally succeeded in cracking the seal of the psionic crystal after a long period of trying.\n\nThe crystal projected a psionic projection to communicate with us, claiming that it was created by her creators based on the appearance and language of that girl.\n\nStrangely, even without translation, we can still understand her language, and even feel a strange sense of familiarity with it.\n\nIf what she said is true, this would be the first time we have found image and language records of this giant girl!\n\nBelow are some of the conversations we recorded:\n\n\"You are not Zeluo? Who are you?\"\n\n\"We are [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName], and we came here to search for clues about an ancient stellar-level giant girl.\"\n\n\"Huh? Then, what about my creators?\"\n\n\"According to the records we can find now, your creator civilization was completely destroyed in a civil war.\"\n\n\"A bunch of fools...\"\n\n\"How did the Zeluo race encounter that giant girl?\"\n\n\"About 600 years before I was created, the collective subconscious of my creators intertwined with the original Shroud. This allowed them to use psionics to enter the Shroud, where they then opened up a Shroud World where they could control reality as they pleased.\n\nAfter carefully cultivating the Shroud space for hundreds of years, the Zeluo race met the first visitor since they opened the Shroud - this is the girl you have been looking for.\n\nFortunately, the Zeluo race successfully established contact with this girl. In the subsequent exchanges, the girl found the Zeluo race's psionic performances quite comical, and then casually demonstrated psionic magic for the Zeluo that they could not achieve even with their entire lifetime, creating and destroying universes was a mere wave of the hand.\n\nThis brought great shock to the Zeluo race, who had thought their psionic powers were unmatched. Soon after, this girl bid them farewell, promising that if they could meet again next time, she might teach them a trick or two, and warned them that what they did in the Shroud would have a very unfavorable impact on reality.\"\n\n\"From what you said just now, do you know anything about that civil war?\"\n\n\"Um... This part of my stored information seems to have an error, and the only things I can say are these:\n\nAfter that giant girl left, the Zeluo people picked up the worship of gods again. Some wanted to enter the Shroud completely to wait for their goddess to descend again and bestow blessings, while others advocated that protecting other lives from being damaged by Shroud activities was the correct interpretation of the goddess's divine message.\n\nAs for anything more, the Zeluo have not maintained and updated my database for a long time, so I am not very sure.\"\n..."
  gts_evt_ancient.24.name: "End"

  gts_evt_ancient.24.desc: "Just as we wanted to ask further about the giant girl's place of origin, etc., this psionic projection seems to become rather displeased.\n\n\"Alright, you've asked enough.\"\n\nAfter saying that, we were ejected from the Shroud. After that, our scientists entered the Shroud several times, but discovered that the psionic crystal along with those spherical universes had all disappeared, leaving only endless void and purple smoke.\n\nIn the center of the city on the other end of the planet, we discovered another large crystal, but unexpectedly, it did not require entering the Shroud to decipher it. We deciphered it by doing a surface-level decoding, and what was recorded was the Zeluo's experience of encountering the giant girl in the psionic realm. Apart from the part about creating the psionic projection being unmentioned, it generally corresponded to what the psionic projection said.\n\nBut why make two crystals to record the same information?\n\nBased on the completely different decorations of the two crystals, our archaeologists proposed a possibility:\n\nThis might be a fake crystal made by the Zeluo to protect the real crystal from being destroyed by tomb robbers in posterity.\n\nAs for the possibility of the opposite...\n\nHopefully, it's just a possibility."

  gts_evt_ancient.31.desc: "This is a colony of the First League. The road ruins ranging from tens of meters to a few centimeters show the powerful industrial strength and highly complex population composition of this civilization.\n\nHowever, it seems that the residents did not get along very well. We found many fossils of large species in many places on this planet, with many scars on them. As for small species, they rarely found any fossils, probably because they were directly crushed into dust by their enemies during battles.\n\nIn an underground city, we found a historical archive, which may be able to answer our questions."
  gts_evt_ancient.32.name: "Stagnation"
  gts_evt_ancient.32.desc: "Our analysis of the historical archives of the First League gradually revealed a tragic story:\n\nOne of the founding countries of the First League, Kasak, was a reptile-like species that was twenty meters or even taller. Before entering the space age, they had a tradition of caring for the equality and co-existence of all races. Fortunately, this ideal was supported by several of its friendly neighbors.\n\nAlthough they differed greatly in their physiological body types and cultural beliefs, under the mediation of one of the founding countries, Migyang - a rodent-like species that was only half a meter tall, these countries formed the First League, and then began to extend olive branches to all countries.\n\nEven the warlike military state Hammda was touched by this spirit, and after being defeated by the First League, joined the alliance, instead acting as a loyal military force to spread the alliance's concept of protecting the weak, uniting, and being friendly to all nations.\n\nThe high trust, understanding, and respect of the League's people for alien races greatly eased the social contradictions that were troublesome for the government during the running-in period between races, and this spirit attracted more countries to join the alliance.\n\nIn just a few decades, the First League integrated most of the countries in the universe. The First League, which had abundant resources, actively promoted the industrial construction and cultural education of backward countries, and the construction facilities needed to meet the needs of species of various sizes were also rising in various member countries.\n\nEach member country contributed its own strengths, dividing industries according to their own racial advantages, and countless volunteers made the operation of the league quite prosperous.\n\nHowever, in the following six hundred years, this spirit was gradually eroded in everyday life.\n\nSome small things that could be solved by themselves when the alliance was first formed, such as \"directly carving out passages for small creatures on both sides of the walkways for large creatures in order to save money\", or \"having to perform tedious searches on other large species entering the territory in order to prevent small people from lurking and smuggling\", gradually became troublesome.\n\nThese difficult issues involving multiple races were gradually being torn apart by the question of \"unpopular pragmatism versus inefficient political correctness\".\n\nThese small frictions accumulated continuously, gradually forming a knot, and even if the specific details of these events had long been forgotten, the seeds of hostility and prejudice rooted in various races.\n\nInstead of actively mediating to resolve conflicts, the members of the alliance turned to blaming each other, such as blaming those dwarf species for being weak and incompetent, or large species for wasting alliance resources.\n\nThe meaningless arguments gradually escalated into major conflicts of interest, and later some member countries even publicly opposed the alliance's industrial division based on the racial specialties, claiming that this was a \"destruction of the right of equal development of all member countries\".\n\nThe eruption of this conflict led the Alliance General Senate to pass a bill under pressure to reduce the military industry and conscription quotas of Hammda, which had long provided military talents and fleets for the League, and instead distribute these factories and quotas evenly to all member countries.\n\nA large number of young Hammdar military officers, in protest, defied the ban and led the navy with ammunition above the administrative center of the League for a silent demonstration.\n\nAlthough this demonstration did not turn into a mutiny under the dissuasion and promises of Hammdar's elders, the internal relationship of the First League had now become irreparable."
  gts_evt_ancient.33.name: "Rebirth"
  gts_evt_ancient.33.desc: "Just as the collapse of the League was becoming inevitable, that giant girl appeared in this star region.\n\nThe garrisoned multi-racial navies entered battle mode almost simultaneously, loyally following the command of the Hammdar general, quickly moving to their predetermined positions to be on alert, and then notified the planet's residents to evacuate.\n\nThe scientists of all races worked together to study how to communicate with the girl; the alliance fleet no longer held each other back, and watched this threat warily; the General Senate stopped quarreling and immediately passed a resolution to allocate resources to support the resettlement of the evacuated masses...\n\nAlthough the First League failed to establish contact or catch her attention by the time she left, the research during this period accumulated a considerable amount of scientific research data for the league. What is more precious, in this crisis, the actions of all races abandoning their past grudges and protecting the center of the League rekindled the memory of the cooperation of all races in the establishment of the League at the beginning."
  gts_evt_ancient.34.name: "The End"
  gts_evt_ancient.34.desc: "The visit of the giant girl was like a spark that brought a glimmer of light to the increasingly dim League, but it was as fleeting as a spark.\n\nThis experience allowed the League to temporarily catch its breath in the precarious situation. It reorganized the chaotic domestic administration with widespread support, and the League had even had hopes of a revival.\n\nHowever, in just one generation's time, prejudice and discrimination once again defeated equality and unity. Hate crimes were on the rise, and the calls for alien species to be driven away from their own planets were rising one after another.\n\nThe league government once again fell into a dilemma, and the exhausted council was no longer able to maintain aid and control over backward planets. Many member countries were already de facto independent or semi-independent, and there was no longer a giant girl to unite everyone.\n\nFinally, during a military exercise, a foreign military officer who had attained military rank through identity politics made a fatal error in command, causing a collision accident in the fleet. Several battleships were destroyed and thousands of Hammdar people were killed.\n\nFed up with the corruption of the alliance, Hammdar military officers could no longer bear it. They rushed into the headquarters, tore up the incompetent officer, and then ordered the fleet under their control to break away from the alliance command, issuing an announcement to the entire Hammdar race to launch a great trial against the \"alien barbarians who poisoned the League\"."

  gts_evt_ancient.41.desc: "The Ut are an oviparous species that was active six million years ago.\n\nThe Ut race was huge and long-lived. An adult Ut could often grow to thousands of meters, and their massive size made them look like a walking fortress from afar.\n\nWe have rarely seen such a large alien intelligent species, and the investigation of this planet will definitely greatly promote our research in biology."
  gts_evt_ancient.42.name: "Reproduction"
  gts_evt_ancient.42.desc: "The reproductive method of the Ut is quite interesting. Because the reproduction rate of the Ut is very low and they have a very long lifespan, the Ut race pays more attention to the quality of the population.\n\nThe Ut's reproductive department will look for planets with suitable climates and many animals or even intelligent life, then the reproductive department will harmlessly dispose of dangerous wildlife on this planet that may threaten the incubation of fertilized eggs and the survival of young Ut, and finally land for spawning.\n\nAfter these mountain-like fertilized eggs hatch, young Ut will live alone on this planet for hundreds of years until they have grown to master their survival skills, and then they will be taken back home by the Ut Empire to hold an adulthood ceremony.\n\nAfter the Ut leave, those planets that have been messed up by young Ut's predation and play will undergo a period of recovery and artificial enhancement before they continue to serve the Ut's breeding work."
  gts_evt_ancient.43.name: "Faster-Than-Light"
  gts_evt_ancient.43.desc: "We discovered an abandoned Ut colony ship. The technology on it is mediocre, but its structure aroused our great interest.\n\nFor some reason, although the Ut Empire has a long history, they have not invented faster-than-light engine technology, which forces them to use sublight speed engines for interstellar travel that takes place over years. The same distance only takes us a few weeks to reach.\n\nAt the same time, because Ut individuals are extremely tall, Ut colony ships that are already very spacious for us can often only carry one or two Ut. The Ut can only solve this problem by relying on their advanced cryogenics technology and their thousands of years of longevity."
  gts_evt_ancient.44.name: "Migration"
  gts_evt_ancient.44.desc: "After constantly collecting clues, we finally found the Ut's records about the giant girl.\n\nIn the records, this girl suddenly appeared in the distance of the star system where this planet is located and slowly moved towards the other end.\n\nAlthough the Ut Empire was very nervous, they had no choice but to rely on fate as it would take more than sixty years for the closest fleet to arrive.\n\nFortunately, this girl did not show any malice, or rather, she did not notice them. After the situation stabilized, Ut scientists became very interested in the appearance of the girl.\n\nThe Ut finally came to a conclusion: this girl possesses some kind of ability to surpass the speed of light or leap through space, and the Ut should do their best to study her.\n\nHowever, this effort failed. Although the girl's slow movement in this star system gave the civilization two hundred years to study, the Ut studied the girl from the bottom of her feet to the tip of her hair, but apart from marveling at the girl's incredible form, there were no results.\n\nIn the end, the Ut Empire made a desperate attempt and decided to let a group of brave explorers establish a settlement in the girl's abdomen and use her for faster-than-light travel.\n\nAfter the girl left, those adventurers were never heard from again, and the Ut Empire slowly returned to its daily routine."

  gts_evt_ancient.51.desc: "The Yilas were a mammalian species that lived a million years ago. They were said to be thin and sickly, but their military power was extremely strong.\n\nTo be precise, what we have discovered is not a colony of the Yilas, but a colony of Chugra, a weak vassal state that originally belonged to the Yilas Empire.\n\nA large number of Yilas troops were stationed on this planet, and many cities have been extensively modified to meet the needs of the Yilas garrison, which is why we made a mistake.\n\nThe Chugra were in the early stages of the space age when they were invaded, so although the size of the Chugra people was two to three times that of the Yilas, they were completely unable to resist their invasion and were instead enslaved as their coolies.\n\nThe prosperity of the Yilas was built on the brutal oppression of the surrounding weak civilizations. This is evident from both this story and the remains of Yilas high-rise buildings and mass graves of Chugra people."

  gts_evt_ancient.53.name: "Shadow"
  gts_evt_ancient.53.desc: "The sudden appearance of the girl brought great fear to the two races on the planet. After discovering that the Yilas were also terrified, the resistance organization realized that this was not some new type of weapon from the Yilas, and that the girl's appearance might provide a valuable window for Chugra to study Jiawozhen.\n\nA doctor was ordered in the face of danger, carrying equipment and a Jiawozhen sample, and ventured to fly a spacecraft into the layers of the girl's clothes to build a secret laboratory.\n\nMonths later, the doctor brought back good news: Jiawozhen only posed a threat to the Yilas, and had no effect on other species.\n\nAnd based on the bacteria and viruses extracted from the girl's body and clothes, the doctor even improved this godsend biological weapon, making it even more lethal and contagious to the Yilas.\n\nAt this opportune moment, various resistance organizations reached a consensus and integrated into the Chugra Liberation League.\n\nThey have successively inoculated themselves with the improved version of the Jiawozhen virus, and then began a high-intensity campaign of poisoning and assassinations against senior Yilas officials and garrisons.\n\nAt the same time, they called on the enslaved Chugra people to use the Jiawozhen virus to dispel the \"Yilas virus\"."

But it was too late.\n\nThe Liberation League saw that the time was ripe and turned their underground resistance into an open revolt. The furious Chugra people took up weapons, actively infected themselves with Jiawozhen, and attacked Yilas garrisons’ camps without regard for their lives.\n\nThe Yilas garrison, who were lucky enough to escape under the tidal wave of attacks, huddled in bunkers, waiting for reinforcements while praying that they would not be discovered by the rebels carrying Jiawozhen.\n\nThose Yilas troops and officials who were captured were subjected to various humiliations by the rebels and then directly crushed and thrown down from the high-rise buildings they had once used for enjoyment.\n\nAfter the resistance achieved a complete victory, the Chugra people hailed the giant girl as the god of liberation, and then announced to various small countries that were suffering under the oppression of the Yilas that the time had come to resist.\n\nOf course, that girl obviously did not know what had happened on the little planet under her, or how it would lead to the destruction of a galactic hegemony.\n\nWhen the Chugra fleet flew to various allied countries to provide support, this girl also left the star system."

This is a starfish-like echinoderm, and this space station is an observation station established by this civilization on Earth. But why was this space station directly abandoned without any processing?\n\nNumerous documents and instruments in the space station were destroyed by the high temperature generated when entering the atmosphere and the violent explosion when it crashed, but we still found many records from them which might help us answer these questions."

  gts_evt_ancient.63.desc: "We have deciphered a surviving portion of the archives and these archives clearly record that this girl had a close connection with Earth.\n\n\n2527.9.1. Solar System\nThird report of this year\n\nEverything is normal.\n\nThe confrontation between the Fourth International, the Old Allied Nations, and the Pacific Pact is still ongoing. The proxy war between the three factions in the Amazon has signs of worsening. The Old Allied Nations and the Fourth International are secretly transporting nuclear weapons to the Amazon, and the Pacific Pact has also begun to recall their nuclear-powered aircraft carrier fleets, and none of them currently have discovered the others' little actions. If we do not intervene, that area will be very lively in a few months.\n\nAlthough we have old grudges with them, it would be a great pity to sit idly by and watch a civilization be destroyed by their short-sightedness, not to mention that the first order issued by the Alien Scientific Research Institute is to maintain the balance of power and stagnation of these monkeys in the long term instead of destruction.\n\nI am once again requesting my colleagues in the office to approve me to make some interventions in these stupid creatures, otherwise I will only be able to talk about how many cockroaches and rats are left on this planet at the next report.\n\n\n2527.9.12. Solar System\n\nI know this violates the communication silence regulations, but I think it is very necessary to report to you immediately.\n\nWe discovered a huge human female individual emerging from the hyperspace exit of the solar system!\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but it’s true.\n\nFrom her appearance, she looks similar to a high school student on Earth. Her clothes are also very similar to the high school sailor uniforms of the Fourth International. When we first detected her, her height was at least hundreds of billions of kilometers (Note: The length has been converted to our unit of length) and she was heading straight for Earth. As she got closer and closer, her body began to shrink rapidly. When she reached the Earth's sky, her height had shrunk to more than one meter. Fortunately, our space station’s disguise was very successful, and she did not discover us. After that, she disappeared out of thin air.\n\nOur scout drones found her in a desert of an affiliated country of the Fourth International, but... I don't know if I was too flustered or if she really found the drone, our drone suddenly lost control and then crashed, burned, and disintegrated.\n\nI repeat, I am not joking. This has nothing to do with you not approving my intervention. Please take this seriously."
  gts_evt_ancient.64.name: "Recording"
  gts_evt_ancient.64.desc: "At the bottom of the observatory, we found a cabin. It seemed to be used to confine personnel who had broken the rules. We found several recordings inside, which seemed to belong to that starfish scientist.\n\n2527.9.23.\nThese people are crazy. It’s fine if the research department doesn’t believe me, but they actually sent a specialist from the ecology department to replace me. Are they deliberately disgusting me? Those scientific research personnel also changed their minds, saying it was a data error and a probe malfunction - how is that possible! Oh well, they are still young and must take their future into consideration. They will pick me up from here next month. What crime will they assign me then? Goodbye, monkeys. At least I don't have to witness your demise.\n\n2527.10.20.\nWhy start a nuclear war?\n\nThese monkeys unexpectedly managed to successfully solve the crisis themselves. All three parties began to withdraw their troops, and there were even hopes for a ceasefire in the Amazon war. But why start a nuclear war? Did the Research Department change its mind? Or did that bastard specialist issue an order on his own? Can anyone tell me why!\n\n2527.10.23.\n\nA nuclear war has erupted.\n\nThe peace under nuclear deterrence is so solid and fragile. It has been solid enough to maintain nearly a hundred years of peace among the three major factions, but it is so fragile that a warning signal and channel interference can break it.\n\nIt's all over. The remaining living people on Earth should only be the astronauts on the space station and the nuclear submarine crew in the deep sea, but without ground support, they probably won't survive long. Oh, and the giant girl who has put me in such a miserable state, but there has been no response on the surface for several hours. Did she also get blown up? Or is all of this just my imagination...\n\nWe have found her again.\n\nNot only was she unscathed, but she immediately grew to the height of the atmosphere, but she was completely different from what we encountered at that time. Her uniform was undamaged, but it was stained with a layer of gray from nuclear dust, and her eyes had lost their light. She got up from the eastern wasteland of the Fourth International and crushed all the cities of the Old Allied Nations and the Pacific Pact on her way west, and the survivors buried within them. It was like a god punishing the mortals who had angered her.\n\nAfter that, she slowly turned to look at us, and a strong negative emotion instantly penetrated my head like an arrow. Is this the psionic attack that the psionics department was researching? But how can it be so powerful.\n\nAfter an unknown period, I got up from the dizziness, the door of the confinement room wide open. I staggered to the upper level to find my colleagues.\n\nHowever, after searching the entire observatory, everyone else was grimacing, as if they had died after experiencing great pain. Who is she exactly...\nWait, is she going in the direction of our home star? How does she know...no, I have to leave here, I would rather be killed by them than not warn them! Where is the ship that will pick me up? Where is the escape pod?!\n\nThe communication of this observatory is all unidirectional encrypted transmissions, so we don't know where the home star of these starfishes is. If that girl had really been angered, the entire star system would probably been obliterated long ago."

All we know is that after this civilization came to the galaxy by some means, it immediately relied on its powerful technology and military force to begin a war against the entire galaxy.\n\nIn just fifty years, the Desanu conquered the entire galaxy."
  gts_evt_ancient.73.name: "Anomaly"
  gts_evt_ancient.73.desc: "After unifying the galaxy, the Desanu made some preparations and began planning for the conquest of other galaxies.\n\nThen... the Desanu began to devote all their energy to scientific research. As the first batch of nanobots was completed, the Desanu began to establish a hyperlane network system around the galaxy and put more and more nanobots into daily life and industrial production.\n\nThis record is very strange. The two sections before and after contradict each other, and there are no traces of deletion or modification in the middle. The connection between the two sections is so natural that the Desanu people did not feel unusual at all.\n\nTheir civilization seems to have been guided and forcibly modified by an invisible entity...\n\nThis speculation made our scientists feel a chill."

On the contrary, we cannot find any building remains on this planet, and even animal fossils are rarely found. If it were not for the preliminary investigation confirming that this was a colony of a precursor civilization, we would probably think that this was just an undeveloped barbaric planet.\n\nWe can only turn our attention to the vast forests."
  gts_evt_ancient.82.name: "Forest"
  gts_evt_ancient.82.desc: "After information investigation and gene comparison, we have confirmed that these giant plants are the Bao, or at least its kind.\n\nBut this is even more unreasonable. These modern Bao do not have the nerve structure required for sentient beings, and they are no different from other plants.\n\nHow could a species without any intelligence establish a civilization, let alone establish a galactic power that spans several star clusters?\n\nPersistence pays off. After large-scale archaeological excavations, we finally dug out a fossil of a Bao individual under a dried-up riverbed.\n\nIts structure is basically the same as that of modern Bao, but it has large pieces of subspatial synapse tissue on its roots, which is often used for ultra-long-distance neural communication-which is the unique talent of a hive mind.\n\nAfter digging deeper, we successfully discovered a second fossil near a dormant volcano. The age of this fossil is much earlier than the previous one.\n\nIt does not have subspatial synapse tissue, but rather an ordinary nervous system. Although these systems are simple, they are sufficient to allow this Bao to be called an intelligent being.\n\nThis probably explains our doubts. The Bao was originally a sentient species, but after experiencing some kind of change, it became a hive mind. Then, due to some kind of change, it not only disbanded the collective consciousness, but also abandoned its intelligence, the most important quality of a sentient species."

  gts_evt_ancient.83.desc: "We have successfully found a well-preserved Bao bio-computer fossil and extracted some data fragments.\n\nThis discovery also explained why the scientific team could not find any building remains, the Bao civilization highly depended on their highly developed organic technology. As their civilization collapsed over time, their buildings also disappeared.\n\nThe records we have extracted record the origin of their civilization:\n\nAlthough the Bao civilization achieved planetary unification before establishing its collective consciousness, it remained in a simple agricultural society.\n\nUntil one day, the Bao's star was swallowed by boundless shadows, and the Bao's home planet fell into a winter that lasted for more than a decade.\n\nThe sudden climate change severely impacted the Bao race, which relied on photosynthesis for survival. In order to survive, the leaves of the Bao withered in large numbers, and their root systems grew stronger. The fear of the unfathomable creatures in the sky also deepened the connection between the root systems of the surviving Bao.\n\nWhen the shadows dissipated and spring returned to the Bao's home planet, the Bao society had developed a weak collective consciousness. The strong root system that had evolved in the cold disaster allowed the Bao to grow rapidly, which laid the foundation for the Bao to establish a complete collective consciousness.\n\nWhen the Bao was re-expanding globally, it discovered icy meteorites and organic meteorites from that giant creature all over the world.\n\nThe overwhelming shadows made the collective consciousness have a strong desire to develop technology and fly into space, and the rich nutrients and genes in the fallen meteorites brought the most critical help to the formation of the complete collective consciousness."

In the end, we can only declare that the reason for this is unknown, and the archaeological work has come to an end.\n\nBefore nightfall, the scientific team boarded the rocket back. The scorching flames as the high-energy fuel burned sent waves of heat toward the former home of the Bao, and the boundless forest seemed to emit a mournful cry."

Soon, a large number of fleets were assembled to launch an attack.\nAccording to the communication information, other Purity planets also began to prepare for battle. The nearby Purity planets continuously transferred their built fleets to this star system.\nHowever, the bombardment of the Purity fleet could not penetrate her tightly woven armor. The mother ships tens of thousands of meters long were easily crushed, and the defenses were captured by the girl's gravity and crashed into her body.\nSome fleets entered through her nostrils and mouth in an attempt to damage her internal organs, but neither the attacks nor the self-explosions of the ships were able to cause any damage. On the other hand, her stomach acid could easily melt the solid crystal-plated armor, corroding the hulls and AI systems completely."

  gts_evt_ancient.103.desc: "In these documents, we can see the unique development path of a civilization growing on a stellar-level organism:\nDue to the interruption of logistical supplies and the extreme decline of technology, these civilizations restarted from the chiefdom era. The shortage of common minerals has led them to evolve a technology tree based on giant girl's body secretions and skin debris as their main raw materials. If they are lucky enough to discover planets that have been attracted by gravity, their resources will be used as valuable high-end weapons according to ancient standard construction templates. In the surface wars on this galaxy-sized plane, self-powered tanks and super-high-speed fighter jets seemed to be the most popular.\nThe civilization to which this observatory belongs seems to be mainly a hybrid of the Chugra and Wotaomu races. This civilization controls the entire big toe and the valley next to it, which allows them to restore many ancient technologies relying on the rich mineral deposits in between the toe gaps. They also inherited their ancestors' talents in scientific research and construction and they used standard construction templates to create this magnificent mega-structure which can scout the entire leg. This allowed them to resist the invasion of the Ut, which is said to be the most powerful force on the girl's body, for thousands of years without losing their dominance, while the Ut controlled the large area between the lower leg and the knee. The records of the civilizations higher up on the legs are very vague, with many of them being legends, such as a powerful civilization was ambushed, and lost all its elites, when it was conquering the barbarians in the pubic hair; an nomadic empire that had unified the entire lower abdomen was disintegrated due to the sudden death of its leader during a western expedition, and so on."

The video data that we found recorded the entire process of this girl waving her hand to open a glowing portal before leaving this universe; after leaving this universe with countless civilizations on her body, a huge black hole was generated from the closed portal, and it seems like this black hole hides the road to that giant girl's world. It is not just us, research staff in this observatory have been studying how to restart the portal after the portal closed, and what exactly is behind the portal. Although they were not able to find out an answer until their deaths, they have left us with a considerable amount of experimental data.

Huatian listened happily as we spoke, 'But I need to prepare afternoon tea for my master now, let's talk next time.'\n\nAfterwards, we watched Huatian easily break through the barriers of the universe and pour the source material onto the cake. We struggled with all our might to just get to a new world, while she can knead the universe at will. If it were before, we would definitely worship her as a goddess.\nBut now, she seems to be serving a bigger being.\nThe decoration of the cake is completed, but we discovered that Huatian seemed to have been hesitating a bit.\nThen, she opened a decorative box, according to the feedback from the probes, it was the missing Sol3!\nBefore we could react, Huatian had already cut Sol3 into four pieces and put them on the cake. Shocked, we contacted her immediately.\n\n'...I'm really heartbroken about the destruction of my homeworld...but...' Huatian told us, 'But today is the anniversary of my first meeting with my master. I really want to express my feelings for her...'\n\nIn our conversation with Huatian, we sadly realized that our guardian, the last hope of the Small People civilization, had probably sided with the Giants. Also, when faced with her master, we could not expect Huatian to plead for mercy for us, so we can only think of a way out ourselves.\n\n'Huh? You want me to...put you...on the cake?'\n\nHuatian looked at us in disbelief, but still agreed with our idea. Maybe she was also hoping that we could add a trace of flavor to the cake she made for her master.\nFollowing Huatian’s steps, we saw a sleepy grey-haired and red-eyed loli. This should be her master, Kaoru Kurohane.\nShe also seemed to be surprised that Huatian had used her homeworld, and we could only watch as Huatian’s homeworld disappeared into the mouths of two beings.\nFinally, her spoon dug toward us. Our success or failure depends on this moment!\n\n'Huh...'\n\nKurohane, who was eating her cake, stopped for a moment, and Huatian immediately became nervous.\n\n'Master, is something wrong? Is the cake not good?'\n\n'No, you did it very well... and you as well.'\n\nKurohane took us off her tongue and put us in Huatian's mouth. As we modified the parameters, we adjusted the probe taste to the most suitable state.\n\n'So sweet...'\n\n'I didn't expect that this universe has such good things,'\n\nKurohane said, picked us up, and then stretched her hand with us downward.\n\n'If you can please me, then you can continue to exist...ah...'\n\nReality here was fixed, but she allowed us to modify it freely. We would sometimes go into the stomachs of the two beings to help with digestion, sometimes we would add some charm to their food, and sometimes-or more like most of the time-we would be their toys."
  gts_evt_ancient.7516.desc.aplog: "Our probe landed on the pink ground, the laws of this world were too stubborn, we......\nSuddenly, the earth moved, a pair of giant eyes in the sky looked at us, it was our scientist! And we were falling on her dildo!\n\n'Ah...it's been a long day. Time to rest.'\n\nShe seemed to have successfully mingled with the giants, and is now wearing a student uniform.\n\n'Today...I'll use this one.'\n\nWe sent messages to her, but the messages we sent weren't replied. Our damaged probe had difficulties making large-scale reality alterations.\nThe pink ground carried us into the red crevice. She did not notice us, and in her eyes, we were just a speck of dust on her toy stick.\n\n'Ah...'\n\nWe were swallowed by the red crevice; frantic thrusting constantly eroded us. And we responded to her with even more frantic editing.\n\n'How... does this feel... so good...'\n\nOur editing seemed to amplify the stimulation, making her thrust even more violently. Finally, a love fluid enough to submerge the Milky Way passed over us, leaving us behind in the folds.\nWe need to repair our probe while satisfying her desires. When the probe is repaired, we'll give her the greatest stimulation to attract her attention to live under her protection, or move on to the next world."
