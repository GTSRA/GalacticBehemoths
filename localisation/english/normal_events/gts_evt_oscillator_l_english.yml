  d_oscillator_surface: "Vibrator Planet Ecosystem"
  d_oscillator_surface_desc: "The entire planet is a giant vibrator!  A unique ecosystem has evolved on the surface of this abandoned giant vibrator, consisting mainly of towering metal peaks, bottomless oceans of love fluids, and rivers of highly concentrated energy."
  d_oscillator_ruin1: "Filth Mountains"
  d_oscillator_ruin1_desc: "These mountains are not made of rock, but of piles of giantess bodily fluids and crystallized love juices."
  d_oscillator_clean1: "Love Fluid Crystal Veins"
  d_oscillator_clean1_desc: "After clearing away the mountain-like giantess filth, valuable veins of love fluid crystals are revealed."
  d_oscillator_ruin2: "Foul-Smelling Swamp"
  d_oscillator_ruin2_desc: "A byproduct of the giantess's orgasm, large amounts of uncleaned love fluids have gathered into oceans, becoming a breeding ground for disease and threatening the health of the colonists."
  d_oscillator_clean2: "Love Fluid Swamp Development Zone"
  d_oscillator_clean2_desc: "Aphrodisiacs in the love fluid have been refined, becoming a very popular drug in the colony."
  d_oscillator_ruin3: "Inactive Motor Engine"
  d_oscillator_ruin3_desc: "Once upon a time, this motor produced power comparable to a stellar explosion, driving the vibrator to stimulate the giantess's sensitive areas."
  d_oscillator_clean3: "Motor Engine"

  d_oscillator_clean3_desc: "Through clever modifications by imperial engineers, we are continuously drawing immense energy from the battery.  As long as some unlucky soul doesn't accidentally activate the vibrator and shake the entire colony to pieces, that is."
  gts_oscillator.1.name: "[From.GetName] System"
  gts_oscillator.1.desc: "Our scientists have discovered a massive artifact in [From.GetName]. Based on its shape and appearance, we speculate that it is a sex toy left behind by a planetary-sized giantess.\n\nAccording to our preliminary investigation, this...planet? Or rather, this vibrator, still has remnants of the giantess's bodily fluids, forming lakes that have not yet dried on its silicone shell.  And the bacteria left in the giantess's vagina... are also growing wildly on this planet. They have become a highly infectious pathogen. Currently, it seems that those infected become manic, obsessed with reproduction, and crave intercourse. Giantess matters are truly wondrous, aren't they?\n\nOverall, we believe that this planet has the conditions for colonization. It can be used for industrial production, etc. At the same time... for the giantess user... are the tiny particles also part of the fun?"

 gts_oscillator.3.desc:0 "Huge amounts of machinery were shipped into the port, countless filling materials were stuffed into gullies, excavators collided with mountains of filth, and countless water conservancy projects were built in the river channels formed by Giantess fluids. We have solved the surface problems of this vibrator. Whether as a sex toy or a colony planet, it is now up to standard."

 gts_oscillator.4.desc:0 "Our long-term neglect of [Root.GetName] has led to severe deterioration of the planet's living environment. Whether it's the filth mountains decomposing with bacteria, the frequent and unstable love juice climate, or the unstable geological structure, our citizens find it hard to survive. If we want to bring this planet back into use, terrain clearing is necessary. Please restructure the geography of this planet as soon as possible."

 gts_oscillator.6.desc:0 "Neglect of [Root.GetName] has allowed the lust virus to spread unchecked. Our original medical system was completely unable to cope with this virus. The inhabitants of the planet are falling into madness one by one, leaving their families and jobs to violently release their desires on the streets. The order here is a mess, like an orgy.

 # 在海量工程师们的共同努力下，这颗星球的核心部分：他的动力部分终于被修复完毕了。他庞大的体积已经不亚于我们修建过得任何一座巨构，修复这样一个庞大而又精细的机器花费了我们无数的心血，现在该来看看他的威力了。\n\n一名自告奋勇的工程师拉开了动力机的保险部分，随后，当开关被拉下时，一场席卷全球的超大地震便开始了，我们的建筑在这样恐怖的地震面前，就像是一缕灰尘一般，如果没有防护措施，我们的公民难以在这种地震下存活哪怕一秒....巨大的能量摧毁了那些偷工减料的房屋，而这，只是这颗跳蛋的测试档..。很难想象..这就是我们与行星级巨娘的差距吧...\n\n不过，我们也修建了相应的减震避难所，他..应当会起到作用的。
 gts_oscillator.7.desc:0 "Thanks to the joint efforts of countless engineers, the core part of this planet: its power unit has finally been repaired. Its massive size is no less than any megastructure we have built. Repairing such a huge and sophisticated machine cost us immense effort. Now it's time to see its power.\n\nA volunteer engineer pulled the safety of the power unit, and then, as the switch was pulled, a massive earthquake swept the globe. Our buildings were like dust in the face of such a terrifying earthquake. Without protective measures, our citizens couldn't survive a second... Massive energy destroyed jerry-built houses, and this was just the test gear of this vibrator... Hard to imagine... this is the gap between us and the Celestial Giantess...\n\nHowever, we also built corresponding shock-absorbing shelters. It... should work."

 # 当我们来到[Root.GetName]的最核心处时，一台极其巨大的机器便出现在了我们面前...它比我们见到的任何动力机都要大，即使是主宰舰的动力机也没有这么大的大小...。根据我们的判断，修好它需要花费大量的合金以及时间，而作为这颗星球得关键，只有修好这台机器，这个跳蛋才能重新发挥他的作用。
 gts_oscillator.8.desc:0 "When we arrived at the core of [Root.GetName], a huge machine appeared before us... It was larger than any power unit we had seen, even the Juggernaut's power unit wasn't this big... According to our judgment, repairing it will take a lot of alloys and time. As the key to this planet, only by repairing this machine can the vibrator function again."

 # 啊哈！这颗跳蛋可算是能正常运转了，不过问题也出现了：我们是留着他当做一颗星球呢，还是把他献给帝国的领袖们呢，请您能考虑好，用脑子想就能知道，一旦巨娘使用该星球，我们建设的所有地区的设施都会被§R摧毁§!！啊啊当然还有公民..当然。
 gts_oscillator.10.desc:0 "Aha! This vibrator is finally working properly. But a problem arose: should we keep it as a planet, or dedicate it to the empire's leaders? Please consider carefully. Anyone with a brain knows that once a Giantess uses this planet, all facilities we built in every region will be §Rdestroyed§! Ah, of course, citizens too... naturally."

 # §H“嗯？这颗星球...真的是一个跳蛋诶！是要给我用？嗯...”§!\n\n来到此处的[Root.GetName]对着这个新奇的跳蛋上下审视者，像她这样的天体级巨娘，已经很久没有见过与自己相匹配大小的东西了，如今这么一个专业的，符合自己尺寸的情趣用品出现...再也不需要用脏兮兮的星球和用手自慰了...难怪她会那么兴奋。\n\n[Root.GetName]在这颗小星球先夹蹭着自己的双腿，其丰富的想象力让她的下身被变得有些湿润，于是乎[Root.GetName]便星球上公民们面前，轻轻的拉开自己下半身的衣物，将潮湿粘热的私处暴露在整个玩具前。\n\n§H“情趣用品...上面还有小人，小人们建立的城市会不会比那些脆弱泥巴星球上的建筑更结实呢？嘛，试了就知道了啦”§!\n\n[Root.GetName]调整了自己的体位，撇开双腿，一边握住这颗星球，一边用其轻轻的在穴口摩擦着。\n\n§H“嗯啊..这颗小星球硬硬的诶，终于不是像那些小泥土一样，轻轻一捏就碎掉～。这样的玩具我很喜欢哦”§!\n\n在爱液的润滑下，我们的跳蛋星球被一点点的塞进了[Root.GetName]身体的隐秘之处，巨大的肉墙和无边无际的滔天洪水，正不断打击着我们所建设的城市，我们的市民们纷纷都躲在加固的避难所中。\n\n§H“诶呀，塞进去了呢，是时候启动试试了”§!\n\n这颗巨大的跳蛋再次被启动，他所产生的震动比我们测试中的幅度要大很多。一瞬间，我们在上方修建的各种避难工事，便在剧烈的震动和肉壁无意识的挤压下变为废墟，建筑材料和和血肉不均匀的浸泡在爱液当中，形成了跳蛋上新的污垢....\n\n§H“呜啊，酥酥麻麻的，真舒服...这可比那些没用的小星球什么的棒多了。不过话说，里面的小人们还活着嘛？”§!\n\n当然，跳蛋星球上的[owner.gts_event_kills_logs]个居民和[owner.gts_event_city_kills_logs]座城市都已经被送进了[Root.GetName]的尹红深渊之后。
 gts_oscillator.12.desc:0 "§H“Hmm? This planet... is really a vibrator! Is it for me? Hmm...”§!\n\n[Root.GetName] arrived and looked the novel vibrator up and down. As a Celestial Giantess, she hadn't seen anything matching her size for a long time. Now that such a professional sex toy fitting her size appeared... she no longer needed to use dirty planets or her hands to masturbate... No wonder she was so excited.\n\n[Root.GetName] rubbed her legs against this small planet. Her rich imagination made her lower body moist. So [Root.GetName] gently pulled open her lower garments in front of the citizens, exposing her wet, warm private parts to the toy.\n\n§H“Sex toy... with little people on it. Will the cities built by little people be sturdier than those on fragile mud planets? Well, I'll know once I try”§!\n\n[Root.GetName] adjusted her position, spread her legs, held the planet, and gently rubbed it against her entrance.\n\n§H“Mmm... this little planet is hard. Finally not like those little mud balls that shatter with a pinch~. I like this toy”§!\n\nLubricated by love juice, our vibrator planet was slowly stuffed into the hidden depths of [Root.GetName]'s body. Massive flesh walls and boundless floods constantly struck the cities we built. Our citizens hid in reinforced shelters.\n\n§H“Ah, it's inside. Time to turn it on”§!\n\nCurrently, the massive vibrator was activated again. The vibration it produced was much larger than in our tests. In an instant, the various shelters we built above turned into ruins under violent vibration and unconscious squeezing of flesh walls. Construction materials and flesh soaked unevenly in love juice, forming new filth on the vibrator...\n\n§H“Ooh, tingly and numb, so comfortable... This is much better than those useless small planets. By the way, are the little people inside still alive?”§!\n\nOf course, the [owner.gts_event_kills_logs] residents and [owner.gts_event_city_kills_logs] cities on the vibrator planet have already been sent into the crimson abyss of [Root.GetName]."
