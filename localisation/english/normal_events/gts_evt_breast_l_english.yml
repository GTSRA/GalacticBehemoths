  NAME_1096: "CX-1096"
  NAME_1000: "CX-10-G"
  planet_breast: "Central Line-K Branch"
  system_breast: "Central Line-K-Z2"
  gts_dry_season: "Dry Season"
  gts_dry_season_desc: "The mirrored planet in the breast universe has entered a year-long dry season. Temperature and air quality return to normal, and the sea of milk flooding most of the planet rapidly recedes, leaving behind a fertile wasteland. The planet's inhabitants can use this time to rebuild and trade with the Inner Ring Empire."
  gts_wet_season: "Wet Season"
  gts_wet_season_desc: "The mirrored planet in the breast universe has entered a year-long wet season. Evaporated milk clings to the mirrored planet, increasing the temperature and filling the air with an arousing sweet smell. Most of the planet is submerged in milk, halting unfinished projects and pausing trade with the Inner Ring Empire."
  gts_trade_with_breast_pop_high: "Increased Trade with Breast Universe"
  gts_trade_with_breast_pop_high_desc: "The Inner Ring Empire's victories in subduing the deep sea and seizing other milk conduits further drive trade between our nations."
  gts_trade_with_breast_pop_normal: "Trade with Breast Universe"
  gts_trade_with_breast_pop_normal_desc: "Trade with the civilizations in the breast universe significantly boosts the circulation of goods and economic growth in our country."
  gts_trade_with_breast_pop_low: "Decreased Trade with Breast Universe"
  gts_trade_with_breast_pop_low_desc: "The Inner Ring Empire's struggles during defense against deep-sea aggressions and reclaiming territories cause a trade recession between our nations."
  d_gts_breast_sea: "Sea of Milk"
  d_gts_breast_sea_desc: "An endless ocean of milky white, exuding a rich dairy aroma. With minimal processing, this milk is potable."
  GTS_BREAST_PROJECT: "Establish Communication"
  GTS_BREAST_PROJECT_DESC: "By stabilizing communication frequencies and translating languages, we may uncover many mysteries of this planet."
  gts_evt_breast.1.name: "Subspace Anomaly"
  gts_evt_breast.1.desc: "As our colony spreads out, we detected an unusual subspace fluctuation in a canyon. Upon investigation, we discovered this fluctuation might be a communication signal from distant space! This could be the key to unraveling the mysteries of this planet."
  gts_evt_breast.1.a: "Got it"
  gts_breast_category: "Milky White Ocean"
  gts_breast_category_desc: "The extensive milky white ocean is easily visible from above."
  gts_evt_breast.2.name: "Sea of Milk"
  gts_evt_breast.2.desc: "Research confirms that this isn't just a white sea; it's milk with high nutritional value and excellent taste. Additionally, this sea experiences tidal activity every two years, each lasting a year, though the cause remains unknown. Our scientists strongly recommend establishing a permanent colony on this planet for extended study."
  gts_evt_breast.10.name: "Establish Communication"
  gts_evt_breast.10.desc: "After months of effort, we have unlocked the subspace communication port. Surprisingly, this empire's species bears many similarities to our nation."
  gts_evt_breast.11.desc: "Greetings, people of [Owner.GetName], on behalf of the Inner Ring Empire. There are no historical records of your civilization or branch line in our archives. Where do you hail from?"
  gts_evt_breast.11.a: "Branch line? What branch line? We are from the Milky Way"
  gts_evt_breast.12.desc: "The Milky Way? We've never heard of such a place, but it seems that while we exist in different universes, our origins are the same. Do you reside in the right breast, or in another mermaid's breast in the star sea?"
  gts_evt_breast.12.a: "Star sea mermaid?"
  gts_evt_breast.12.a.response: "Are you unaware of the world you live in? It seems the Great Flood has caused more damage to your history than anticipated.\n\nThe star sea mermaids are the largest of the species, dwelling in voids untouched by other life forms. All life originates from their breasts, forming civilizations and vying for dominance. When cycles end, a massive surge of milk from deep space annihilates all life in the universe.\n\nAfter the apocalypse ends, new breasts emerge, expanding the universe with new galaxies and planets. Survivors of the last catastrophe begin anew, establishing fresh civilizations."
  gts_evt_breast.12.b: "Do you know about the Sea of Milk on our planet?"
  gts_evt_breast.12.b.response: "This planet and the entire branch line we communicate with were recently discovered by the empire's surveyors. Unlike other planets in our universe, this planet’s sea is acidic, and it experiences four seasons. It seems that your planet and ours swapped places due to unknown reasons, allowing us to discover each other.\n\nThis phenomenon may be unusual for you, but it's a normal occurrence in every planet of our universe. The ocean tides nourish our civilization-though they also breed pests."
  gts_evt_breast.12.c: "Could you tell us more about your empire?"
  gts_evt_breast.13.desc: "As our empire's name suggests, we were born in the core of the Central Milk Duct. Through centuries of struggle, the Inner Ring Empire has accomplished what no previous civilization could: unifying the Central Milk Duct.\n\nBut this prosperity didn't last long. As we planned exploration toward the other two milk ducts and the milk outlet, our borders faced invasions from the two ducts. These beasts, self-proclaimed as the deep sea, resemble humans but are clad in heavy armor, with a single individual equal to a battleship, and seemingly endless in number. We barely maintain the front line at great cost.\n\nHistorical records indicate we've battled these invaders for tens of millennia. The deep sea once surrounded our capital, and our forces have penetrated their milk ducts multiple times. Currently, the empire maintains a defensive stance on the planets at the junction of our three milk outlets. Our contest with the deep sea remains unresolved.\n\nRest assured, as long as we stand, you can remain at ease."
  gts_evt_breast.13.a: "This situation hints at a potential trade opportunity, doesn’t it?"
  gts_evt_breast.13.a.response: "That would indeed be ideal. Our citizens are curious about another world, and I'm sure we can reach mutually beneficial trade agreements."
