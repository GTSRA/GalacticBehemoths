Our scientists found possible links in these disappearances, pointing to two most likely places: a school, serving as a cover for advanced research, or a residential area where researchers live.\nWe need to focus on one for further investigation. Which should be our priority?"
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.1.a: "Focus on the residential area"

  gts_evt_xiankeyan.41.a: "One minute, make it concise."
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.42.desc: "I'm Miku, a synthetic from the future.\nIn my time, resources dwindled severely. Technology came at the cost of environmental ruin, leading to catastrophic disorder.\nIn hopes of change, researchers created me, sent back in time by-I'm unsure how to title this, but let's call them a deity.\nThus, I excelled in your advanced research tests, appointed as chair overseeing scientific advancement.\nI envisioned shrinking our entire race. This aimed to mitigate drastic pollution and depletion. Alas, in vain."

  gts_evt_xiankeyan.42.a: "What?"
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.43.desc: "Can I ask one last favor?\n\nPlease ensure future development avoids our path. Weigh ecological costs against other benefits during resource extraction."
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.43.a: "Couldn't you try alternative solutions?"
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.43.a.response: "It's futile.\n\n§B*She shook her head with a bittersweet smile*§!\n\nWe certainly tried, but authorities initially claimed nothing was wrong, later acknowledged problems but said nature would heal. Finally, they admitted our hands were tied, suggesting actions should have been taken-but it was too late.\nLocalized attempts yielded poor results. Altered environments could hardly sustain life, with climate restoration proving economically unsustainable, forcing abandonment.\nEven the deity suggested it required human solutions alone."
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.43.b: "How did you become larger, anyway?"
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.43.b.response: "Simple. By adjusting key RF devices within the apparatus, reversing certain mechanisms, this effect is achievable. However, with your current tech, complete comprehension needs time."

  gts_evt_xiankeyan.43.c: "Understood. You can rely on us for change."
  gts_evt_xiankeyan.44.desc: "Yes.\n\nI trust you'll accomplish it. Let that era be altered.\n\n§B*She squeezed out a final smile, her eyes dimming.*§!"
