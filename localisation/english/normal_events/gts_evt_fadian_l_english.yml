  gts_evt_fadian.1.name: "Asteroid Covered in Insane Writings"
  gts_evt_fadian.1.desc: "Our scientists have discovered a strange asteroid within §Y[From.GetName]§! that appears to be covered in unknown writings etched with a high-intensity mining laser. Fortunately, the grammar of the text is not complex and does not require the assistance of our envoy team. After deciphering, our scientists discovered that the text covering the asteroid is full of longing for giantesses. \n\n§E\"Just thinking about giant girls makes me want to eat two more bowls of rice.\" \n\"Wuwuwu, today is the 1087th day of missing giantesses.\" \n\"Passing giantess miss, could you lower your noble eyes and glance at the small stone in front of you?\" \n\"I love your universe-covering little feet, I love your tender soles, I love your toes that can crush planets with ease......\"§! \n\nThese insane quotes covering the asteroid quickly caused a stir on our communication network and aroused the interest of many giantesses within our borders. But strangely, our science ships couldn't find any civilization capable of carving these words in this system-or even the remnants of a habitable planet. The research team's budget is running low, and we need to make a decision soon."
  gts_evt_fadian.1.a: "Allocate more funds and keep searching"
  gts_evt_fadian.1.b: "Giantesses are truly popular"
  gts_evt_fadian.1.c: "We have more pressing matters to attend to"
  gts_evt_fadian.2.name: "Searching for the Caller"
  gts_evt_fadian.2.desc: "Scientists accidentally discovered that the orbit of this star system has shifted. In other words, it seems that a planet has suddenly disappeared. Using this clue, we quickly simulated the \"missing planet\". But to everyone's surprise, that planet has now been shrunk to the size of a pea, just like the shrunken planets we sell! A satellite from this pre-spaceflight civilization revealed what happened: One day, a star-sized giantess was deeply moved after seeing this text and wanted to shrink herself to enter the system and surprise the author. However, due to her lack of skill, the shrinking ray hit the home planet, shrinking the entire planet to the size of a bean."
  gts_evt_fadian.2.a: "What a pity"
  gts_evt_fadian.2.b: "Copy it, our girls have a new toy"
  gts_evt_fadian.2.c: "Who knows what diseases these creatures might have, activate the neutron sweep"
  gts_evt_fadian_project: "Searching for the Caller"
  gts_evt_fadian_project_DESC: "The insane writings covering the asteroid have caused a stir within the empire and are expected to become the next generation of meme emojis. We need to find out where the original author's civilization is as soon as possible."
  gts_continent_trail_category: "Continental Traces"
  gts_continent_trail_category_desc: "We have observed unusual traces on this planet. The largest continent of §Y[From.GetName]§! has sunk hundreds of meters under external force. This will be a good research project for us."
  gts_evt_fadian.3.name: "Footprint"
  gts_evt_fadian.3.desc: "Our investigation is complete. The great force that altered the entire planetary structure was nothing more than a footprint left by a \"girl.\" If we ignore her terrifying size, such a footprint could even be described as \"petite.\"\n\nWe also observed other things within the footprint, including a city-state that appears to be in the \"Renaissance\" period. Of course, they are completely extinct. The traces left by an entire civilization may only be what we have found here, beneath the foot of this girl.\n\nIn addition, the magma that surged out after the girl's foot nearly reached the planet's core has cooled and solidified over time, forming extremely high-quality ore. And even just a small amount of bodily fluid left by such a gigantic girl is enough for us to use for a long time."
  gts_evt_fadian.3.a: "Let's collect the remains of this civilization"
  gts_evt_fadian.3.b: "Let's collect the useful resources"
