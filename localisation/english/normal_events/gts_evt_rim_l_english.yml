  gts_evt_rim.1.name: "Native Civilization"
  gts_evt_rim.1.desc: "Investigation reveals that this ring world is built upon a massive metal ring! Though who placed such a colossal structure here and for what purpose remains unknown, our analysis suggests the native flora and fauna on the ring originated from grime on the metal. Our scientists recommend setting up a long-term observation post to uncover the truth."

  site_gts_ring_world_desc: "Who crafted this engineering marvel?"
  gts_evt_rim.2.name: "Toe Ring World"
  gts_evt_rim.2.desc: "Our excavation and secret exploration of the ruins verify a startling hypothesis: this ring world is a lost toe ring of some giantess. Unfortunately, current clues do not reveal her identity or whereabouts. However, it is evident that the primitive species now residing in this toe ring evolved from sweat deposits, with the ruins on the ring being their undertaking."
  gts_evt_rim.2.a: "A toe ring? This..."
  gts_evt_rim.3.name: "Global Trek"
  gts_evt_rim.3.desc: "From the first life sprouting from foot sweat, four major clans gradually formed on the ring's inner walls. Thanks to the formidable psychic prowess of the 'creator' giantess, these species developed their unique psychic theories-alleging that a colossal giantess crafted this flat world, granting them wisdom. Strangely, this correlated with the truth to some extent. With the extensive surface area of the ring, the clans lacked expansion desires until the launch of the first artificial satellite made them aware of each other's existence, marking the era of great discoveries. Despite vast differences in species and languages, shared belief systems fostered friendly relations among them. In the space age, these clans cooperatively transformed their habitat, shaping it into a ring-like world."
  gts_evt_rim.3.a: "Interesting."
  gts_evt_rim.4.name: "Endgame"
  gts_evt_rim.4.desc: "However, further explorations into the psychic realm led to calamity. Upon their first venture into the virtual domain, the clans' psychics proclaimed their world as a gift from the creator goddess. Yet, disagreements arose over her appearance: a passionate elder sister, a learned senior, a culinary expert childhood friend, or a captivating little sister. This led to rapid deterioration of relations, dividing the nearly complete ring world into four segments and starting a cold war. Ultimately, to demonstrate faithfulness, they wielded weapons against neighbors, destroying their civilization, retreating to a medieval state."
  gts_evt_rim.4.a: "We must thoroughly reassess our religious doctrines."
  gts_evt_rim.4.b: "At least they left us a fairly ingenious ring world."
