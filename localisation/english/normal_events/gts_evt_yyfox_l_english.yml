  gts_leader_yyfox.1.desc: "[One afternoon, in an empty room belonging to Million-Salt]\n“Million-Salt, I came to find you-eh, where are you?” Originally visiting to discuss work, Omega knocked with no response, gently pulling open the door. The fox was not inside. The bed was neatly made, with her military coat and two black stockings draping from the bed edge. Remembering her words, “If I'm not there, just wait inside,” Omega entered, glancing around.\nAs time passed, the sun setting on the table turned into a gentle dusk. The wall clock pointed at 5pm, ticking steadily. Bored, Omega browsed his phone in hopes of finding some amusement.\n“Hehe~ Cute Million-Salt-chan~ Sniff~”\nOn the first page of saved images emerged a photo of Million-Salt’s legs. Shocked, he instinctively turned off the screen, glancing around. The room remained empty, with chirping birds outside and his own fluttering heart inside. But besides that, silence. Though he came for work, the image of her black-stockinged legs filled him with excitement. The black, elegantly outlining curves against the background, along with the subtly moving toes, awakened his desires completely.\n“If I were... under Million-Salt’s foot... it would be amazing... Sniff-”\nFantasizing about being toyed with by her giantized toes, he drooled slightly, lost in delight. Even the soft “tap tap” of boots crossing the wooden floor went unnoticed. The gloved hands on his shoulders turned him around and in that moment-\n“Omega, so this is the kind of person you are.”\nThe angry face of Million-Salt Fox and this lust-driven Omega finally met. But Omega’s little secret was completely seen through by Million-Salt. Realizing the gravity of the situation, his phone slipped from his hand onto the floor in panic.\n“Hmm? You wanted my photos for perverted thoughts about me, a fox? What a deviant...”\nMillion-Salt tsked, shifting to stand before Omega, kicking the phone still displaying her photo further away with her boot. Then, her playful grin replaced the previous anger on her pink face. She pulled out a device resembling a remote control from her pocket."

  gts_leader_yyfox.2.desc: "“Kagero just gave me a little button-just a press and I can punish idiots like you! Since you did that, shall I punish you?”\nOmega finally realized why he was summoned: her invitation was a trap. He jumped up from his seat, only to bump into her chest and fall back.\n“No-Million-Salt! I didn’t mean it! Please!”\nInstinctively, he pleaded with the mischievous fox before him. But in seconds, the lovable one turned into a little bug on the cushion under a bright light. The large uniformed Million-Salt ignored the tiny, struggling Omega, leaning forward to grip the armrest and slowly lowered her vast rear towards the scurrying fool. With the pantyhose-wrapped prowess descending, the seemingly unamused fox laughed at the tiny resistance near her cleft.\n“A pervert like you wouldn't be subdued by a fox's genitals, right? Seems I’m being too kind, hm?”\nHer grin widened, watching the tiny squirming between the black threads, Million-Salt bent down, slipping off her boot slightly to point the opening at the helpless one on her chair, sealing his fate.\n“Mhm~ Omega~ Welcome to your new home, okay?”\nSeeing the steamy little boot, Omega, who initially wanted to escape, now wanted to crawl back between her lips for refuge. But quickly, her two fingers grabbed his legs and lifted him before her eyes.\n“Seems even little perverts like you get scared, huh?”\nLooking into the giant red blinking eyes and the black maw of the boot beneath, he began begging, but the next second his small body was tossed into the short boot. As he tried escaping from the cavernous boot under the teasing fox face, he realized he might only be freed when she fetches the white cat in the evening.\n“How’s that? If you escape, you're free!”\nSeeing those plush surroundings, Omega grimly grabbed a strand and attempted to climb up towards the seemingly distant opening. Yet the fibers were too slippery, and he fell back onto the soft insole. Every attempt failed; the boot of a mere girl was his unescapable prison."

  gts_leader_yyfox.3.desc: "“Giving up? Can't climb out? Then be my insole for a day as punishment~”\nFreshly freed from the boot, five toes dangled from the boot’s opening, lightly twisting. The same toes worshipped in countless photos, now each larger than his body. Under such scale, the moist pressure inside was nerve-wracking.\nAs the light became blocked by the descending toe, he retreated further into the boot's depths. His diligent escape quickly ended with a fall on the insole. The huge toe closed in from above, looming like a train overhead; turning to flee only made it grow larger, like a rolling ship.\nYet as his world ever-expanded, no relief from the sweat came. Stuck in this overwhelming fear, tiny Omega could only pray for release when Million-Salt finds her feline companion.\n“But until then, he’ll spend the day with his favorite giant feet,” Million-Salt thought, placing her tired feet on the desk. The abrupt change flipped Omega from the pad into the vast shoe world above. Each pore appeared like a neighborhood, and soon only pink mountains remained around him.\nHe remained unaware that those were merely her foot’s prints. Perhaps within those grooves, he'd forget about any perverted thoughts towards friends."
