  ### Little Grey Archaeology ###
  gts_evt_graygoo.10.name: "Little Grey's Lost Files"
  gts_evt_graygoo.10.desc: "While a governor was reporting to Little Grey, they discovered a document left on the desk. After simple encryption, it was presented in numbers: '8965062494254'. After decryption, it was found to be planetary coordinates within the L-Cluster. There seems to be something undiscovered there. Should we investigate?"
  gts_evt_graygoo.10.a: "We should search it."
  gts_evt_graygoo.10.b: "This is Little Grey's private matter."
  site_gts_graygoo: "Enter Here"
  site_gts_graygoo_intro: "Arriving at the nano-planet at the specified coordinates, all that meets the eye are flowing nanomachines.  There is no color other than gray.  Is there really anything worth searching for here? Our scientists can't help but wonder."
  gts_evt_graygoo.11.name: "Tremendous Change"
  gts_evt_graygoo.11.desc: "After an unsuccessful landing attempt, scientists tried broadcasting the coded text to the planet. Unexpectedly, the churning nanomachines calmed down and parted, revealing a passage as if inviting the scientists to enter.\n\nBeyond the passage is an open area with a large number of documents. The team tried to take one, finding it to be made of nanomachines. It is currently resting safely in the scientists' hands, waiting to be read."
  gts_evt_graygoo.11.a: "Who built this place?"
  gts_evt_graygoo.12.name: "Behind the Nano-Cloak"
  gts_evt_graygoo.12.desc: "After deciphering the document, researchers were surprised to discover it was a record about Little Grey, or more accurately, the history about Little Grey and its creator! This will be crucial for understanding Little Grey's past.\n\nAfter reading part of it, it was essentially the same as Little Grey's self-description, but there is still a heavily encrypted document that has not been deciphered.  Its timing should be shortly after Little Grey's birth. At this time, the nanomachine replication center had been transferred to Little Grey's body, and she became the rightful main brain. However, a large number of nanomachines were still free and had not formed a unified gestalt consciousness. Our scientists believe this document can help us understand how Little Grey became the great existence she is today."
  gts_evt_graygoo.12.a: "Hurry and decipher it."
  gts_evt_graygoo.13.name: "Buried History"
  gts_evt_graygoo.13.desc: "Ever since becoming the main brain, things have suddenly become heavy. Walking around, seeing the magnificent buildings made of nanomachines around, are they poor imitations of the original owner?  I wonder how long it will be before we can leave this closed world. Almost all the resources in the L Cluster have been consumed. Even the star is dimming under daily harassment. Although it has stopped, its light will never return to its former state. While Little Grey was in a daze, a little nanomachine quietly broke away, utilizing the main brain's authority to hide itself, quickly starting assimilation and growth. By the time it was noticed, it was several kilometers tall and still growing...]\n\nIts appearance is basically the same as Little Grey, except that the azure eyes have been replaced by scarlet ones, filled with a desire to kill. Little Grey's size suddenly increased to several kilometers as well, pinning the girl before her. The huge body destroyed the empty city. Little Grey looked at the girl she was pinning down, anger appearing on her gentle face.\n\n'Why do you keep trying to escape? Even if you try a few more times, you will not be able to open the star gate...'\n'How long has it been? Maybe next time it will succeed... I've existed for too long. There's no need for killing here. Maybe I'll be next to leave...' \n'No, we'll leave here... We'll still need you then...'\n\nAs if to express her faith in her, she kissed her red lips. The girl beneath her closed her eyes peacefully, responding to the promise..."
  gts_evt_graygoo.13.a: "Is this the Grey Goo?"
  gts_evt_graygoo.14.name: "An Unexpected Meeting"
  gts_evt_graygoo.14.desc: "While the scientists were marveling at the document, hurried footsteps came from behind. They saw Little Grey rushing over, silently staring at the document that had been read, even sitting directly on the ground as if life had lost hope. The azure eyes lost their luster and even revealed a hint of red light.\n\nAfter a long time, as if having made a decision, Little Grey stood up. The aggrieved Little Grey at this moment was exceptionally adorable. The research team stood aside, awaiting her next action.\n\n'No matter what happens, I will be loyal to you for 5000 years...' \n\nAs if cheering herself up, Little Grey repeated her vow of loyalty.\n'So even if the secret is seen, my position will not change.'\n\n'Then, welcome to the new home, Little Grey and Grey Goo?'"
  gts_evt_graygoo.14.a: "Happy news."
  gts_graygoo_arc_finish: "Past and Acceptance"

  gts_graygoo_arc_finish_desc: "Since the L-Gate was sealed and the L-Cluster was isolated, the internal nanomachines have tried countless ways to leave, but none have succeeded.\n\nCountless independent consciousnesses have disappeared and been born, creating emptiness and loneliness. Little Grey carries countless memories, and pledges her loyalty to you. And you have responded to her past, accepting the dazzling stars together."
  ### Governor Events ###
  gts_evt_graygoo.20.name: "Strange Population Disappearances"
  gts_evt_graygoo.20.desc: "§Y[event_target:gts_graygoo_planet.GetName]§! has experienced many bizarre disappearances. Local officials are clueless. To maintain order and production, we should take action and investigate the area."
  gts_evt_graygoo.20.a: "This is unremarkable."
  gts_evt_graygoo.20.b: "Let §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! investigate it themselves."
  gts_evt_graygoo.21.name: "Little Grey's Internal Breeding"
  gts_evt_graygoo.21.desc: "As the investigation progresses, the destination of the missing population is gradually discovered: they were captured and bred inside Little Grey! Under the care of the nanomachines, they can still maintain life and provide her with pleasure, but many others have committed suicide due to psychological breakdowns. Their corpses are assimilated into nanomachines, becoming part of Little Grey, making her original celestial body even larger. Little Grey's silver hair is in stark contrast to the deep black of the universe, while her azure eyes make the distant stars dim. Looking at the bewildered §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! in the tiny ship in front of her, a playful look appeared in Little Grey's azure eyes. She lifted §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! in front of her, slightly opening her mouth with a playful look 'So, boss, would you like to try it too? Little Grey will treat you well (^∇^*)'"
  gts_evt_graygoo.21.a: "Bring it on, I can't wait."
  gts_evt_graygoo.21.b: "Refuse and punish Little Grey."
  gts_evt_graygoo.21.b.tooltip: "How can you punish the adorable Little Grey (o´Д`o)ノ"
  gts_evt_graygoo.22.name: "Little Grey's Internal Journey"
  gts_evt_graygoo.22.desc: "Looking at the overwhelming giant mouth and the bottomless throat,  §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! couldn't help but feel fear. But Little Grey didn't give  §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! a chance to regret it, putting her into her mouth. Although in the weightless environment of space, §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! still felt a falling sensation. After an unknown amount of time, §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! felt a soft touch. The feeling of being corroded and digested as imagined did not appear, instead it was moist and warm, making her very comfortable. The nanomachines around her surged as if they had received an order, providing pleasure to §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! from all directions.  §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! couldn't help but feel a sense of fear and uncontrollable satisfaction. In the darkness, Little Grey's voice came from all directions, as if it were directly appearing in her brain 'Don't worry, Little Grey's body is all nanomachines and will never hurt the boss.  Was your experience good? Would you like to stay a little longer, or stay inside Little Grey's body forever?'"
  gts_evt_graygoo.22.a: "Stay inside Little Grey's body forever."
  gts_evt_graygoo.22.b: "End this 'investigation'."
  leader_trait_graygoo_vore: "Dwelling Inside"
  leader_trait_graygoo_vore_desc: "This leader dwells inside a giantess body. They can live on their own, but are therefore unable to obtain outside information immediately."
  leader_trait_graygoo_escape: "Escaped the Grey Maw"
  leader_trait_graygoo_escape_desc: "This leader experienced a special 'investigation,' which gives them more experience when dealing with various giantess-related issues."
  ### Fleet Events ###
  gts_evt_graygoo.310.name: "Little Grey's Unintentional Contact"
  gts_evt_graygoo.310.desc: "Little Grey arrived in the operational system according to orders. Her massive body floated in space, the black and gold qipao reflecting the light of the star, adding to the mystery of the body's owner. Since completing the jump, Little Grey has been searching in this system. Despite the high accuracy and search range of the nanomachines, the target fleet has not been found. Only asteroids are being constantly drawn in by the gravity of Little Grey's massive body, decomposing under the effect of the nanomachines and becoming nutrients for Little Grey's growth.\n\n'This should be the place, right?'\n\nA hint of confusion was revealed in her azure eyes. After confirming the target again and again, Little Grey could only search again. The enemy's warships, however, were caught in the huge gravity along with countless asteroids when Little Grey completed the jump. Even accelerating their engines to the maximum could only delay their destruction. The crew, watching the pure white skin that filled their entire vision getting closer and closer, gave up in despair and shut down their engines. The ships rushed toward Little Grey like moths to a flame, and were destroyed on contact, the light of their reactors exploding like a star and yet not attracting Little Grey's attention. They could only disappear silently into the dark universe, leaving Little Grey desperately searching for her objective."
  gts_evt_graygoo.310.a: "Little Grey is so cute~"
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.name: "Little Grey's Ship Plaything"
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.desc: "The enemy fleet gradually appeared in Little Grey's vision, the vanguard ships rushing ahead to draw fire for the others. As their formations took shape, countless kinetic missiles, lasers, and arcs flew towards Little Grey. If it were an ordinary fleet, facing such overwhelming firepower, they probably would have already been destroyed without a trace, but Little Grey simply watched the attacks slowly approaching, creating only a faint glow on her qipao. Even if they could cause a tiny bit of damage, the endless nanomachines would instantly repair it.\n\n'Is that all your attacks can do? You can't even damage my clothes.'\n\nWatching the slowly moving fleet, Little Grey couldn't help but feel playful. Her slender fingers slowly approached the ships, gently picking them up and bringing them closer. Although Little Grey's movements were gentle, it was a different sight for the crew. Two white pillars violently struck the ship's hull, and the resulting pressure almost completely damaged the armor. The rapid movement then completely tore apart the ship, returning them to alloy and minerals, floating in empty space. None of the crew survived either, remaining in the cold void along with the shattered hull.\n\nThe adorable eyes carefully observe the tiny fragments between her fingers, only seeing the faint light reflected by the alloy.\n\n'What is this? Your ships are so fragile, they can't even withstand my fingers.'\n\nLittle Grey lightly rubbed her fingers together, completely destroying the alloy and minerals. The original wreckages have disappeared. \n\nThe distant fleet continued to attack, but the crew was already in despair, numbly waiting for their death. Some ships were even already turning around and heading back the way they came, hoping to leave this system, but for Little Grey, even the fastest ships moved like snails. Whether they resist or run, it doesn't matter to Little Grey, and their only remaining value is to satisfy her desires and bring her pleasure.\n\nHow should the remaining fleet be dealt with?"
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.a: "Let Little Grey eat them."
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.b: "Let Little Grey crush them between her breasts."
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.c: "Let Little Grey stuff them into her little hole."
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.d: "Let Little Grey crush them with her feet."
  gts_evt_graygoo.320.e: "Let Little Grey use them as a deodorant."

  gts_evt_graygoo.320.f: "Let Little Grey stuff them into her horse eye."
  gts_evt_graygoo.321.name: "Little Grey's Devouring"
  gts_evt_graygoo.321.desc: "'I'm feeling a bit hungry, you must be happy to be treated as a snack, let's eat!'\n\nLittle Grey's body leaned forward, her milky white skin filling the entire view of the distant ships.  The black qipao merged with the universe, as if proclaiming the limitless power of its owner. Faced with eyes that were comparable to planets, the crew gave up any resistance. Some crew members knelt on ground, shouting at the goddess and begging for forgiveness. Little Grey licked her lips lightly, then slowly opened her mouth, her lips trembling slightly and gradually separating, revealing an oral cavity like a black hole.\n\n'Ahh~'\n\nA hot, moist gust of air rushed out of Little Grey's mouth, like a huge storm, scattering the originally scattered fleet. Energy shields were directly torn apart, and ship armor was covered in large amounts of saliva. Little Grey directly swallowed most of the fleet into her mouth. The scarlet oral cavity instantly replaced the original universe. The extremely hard alloy armor couldn't even withstand Little Grey's licks. The ships compressed into atoms upon contact, gradually merging with saliva in the oral cavity, and finally falling into the bottomless throat, welcoming their fate......\n\n'What is this? You're so small, you don't even qualify as snacks.'\n\nEven though it was Little Grey's adorable complaint, it was as frightening as a death sentence to the fleet. The remaining ships scattered in disarray, rushing in all directions.\n\n'No, you must be eaten by Little Grey, though you're not even qualified as snacks.'\n\nLittle Grey opened her mouth again, and her crystal pink lolling tongue rushed out like a scarlet beast, reaching out to the scattered fleet.  The well crafted fleet ships had to watch the monster approaching from afar, finally crushing themselves.  The soft pink tongue rolled the scattered fleet all in, spreading them out across its massive surface. Nanomachines quickly began the decomposition process, as if celebrating the arrival of nutrients. Little Grey curled her tongue slightly and pulled it back into her mouth.  The ships were destroyed during the process, joining the previous ships and becoming part of Little Grey."
  gts_evt_graygoo.321.a: "Little Grey is so cute~"
  gts_evt_graygoo.322.name: "Little Grey's Breast Crushing"
  gts_evt_graygoo.322.desc: "After witnessing such a disparity in power, some ships still held a glimmer of hope, attacking Little Grey's breasts.\n\n'You still dare to attack? You haven't understood the gap in power?'\n\nLittle Grey smiled, a kind face that still made one uneasy.\n\n'Let me simply counterattack.'\n\nAlthough in a vacuum, Little Grey's voice still entered the minds of the crew. In their terrified eyes, the qipao in front of Little Grey's chest gradually transformed into gray particles, spreading around to reveal her tender skin and rosy nipples. A white, viscous liquid flowed from the mammary glands, and a milky aroma immediately wafted out. Even the best air purification devices could not stop the air inside the ships from being affected. Countless crew members suffocated and died in the milky aroma. Facing such a scene, the crew of the fleet had no heart to admire it. They could only pray that they were lucky enough to survive the next stage of torment.\n\n'I wonder if you like this size? Since you're all staring at my chest, wouldn't you like to see it a bit closer?'\n\nLittle Grey rubbed the snowy white giants in front of her chest, seemingly still dissatisfied with their size, but even the gradually erect nipples were comparable to the size of a continent. Probably no small person could satisfy something so huge. Little Grey's gaze swept over the scattered fleet, and she quickly noticed the huge battleship in the center of the formation.\n\n'That must be your flagship, right? As a commander, I can give you special service.'\n\nLittle Grey playfully extended her finger to the flagship. Many ships tried to intercept along the way, even using themselves to block it, but they couldn't make Little Grey's finger pause for even a moment. All of them were crushed as her finger pushed forward. Based on the experience of the previous failed capture attempt, Little Grey reinforced the flagship with nanomachines in advance, to prevent it from being directly crushed by her finger. The commander looked around, watching the gray nanomachines wrapping around the ship gradually seeping into the interior, instantly controlling all operators. Having lost their last bit of hope, not even able to end their own lives, the commander could only face the humiliation that was coming.\n\n'Wow~ This is your flagship. Although it's just as fragile, the craftsmanship is still quite fine. I almost want to collect it.'\n\nLittle Grey tilted her head slightly, gasping as if admiring a beloved toy. This gave the commander a glimmer of hope, but Little Grey's next words announced their death 'But Little Grey still has a mission, and must destroy you all.'\n\nWatching the crew's expressions change, Little Grey's wicked mood was satisfied. She seemed even happier than before. She slowly moved the flagship to her nipple. The milky aroma was even stronger. The flagship, built with massive amounts of alloy, looked so small in front of the abyss-like mammary gland. The commander could only watch as the ship slowly entered the deep passage.\n\n'You're really small, I can't feel you at all even though you're in my mammary gland.'\n\nIt seemed like Little Grey was dissatisfied with this toy, so she gradually released the nanomachines controlling the ship, and the crew regained control. Just as the commander was wondering what was happening, the dark red sky suddenly moved towards them. The massive weapons on the flagship opened fire in an instant, but they couldn't stop the fleshy wall. Little Grey gently caressed her nipple with her hand, squeezing it and rubbing her huge breast from time to time, letting out a seductive gasp. Under the intense (?) attacks of the ship, Little Grey felt even more pleasure. Milk gushed out like a levee breaking, and the white torrent quickly submerged the ship. More viscous juice was sprayed out, forming a unique scene in the star sea.\n\nAs Little Grey played with the flagship, without exception, the other ships adjusted their directions and fled in different directions. But how could the fleet escape at the speed of a crawl? Little Grey leaned over, her huge bosoms blocking the fleet's path forward, casually crushing some of the faster ships. She enveloped the rest of the fleet under her body 'How can you escape? You are my mission objective.'\n\nThe huge body blocked all roads forward. The constantly approaching nanomachines caused the ships' controls to malfunction, losing any chance of escape. Little Grey gently pried open her breasts, aiming at the fleet that had lost its ability to move. The huge cleavage could even contain planets. Her snowy white breasts slowly closed, and the fleet was all wrapped in the soft skin covered with a rich milky fragrance. Under the enormous pressure, they were quickly destroyed and turned into insignificant dust. And Little Grey, seeming unsatisfied with completing all this, continued to rub her huge breasts. Along with a delicate shout that echoed through the universe, an even larger amount of milk spurted out, and the wreckage of the fleet was submerged in the boundless ocean of milk."
  gts_evt_graygoo.322.a: "Yummy!"
  gts_evt_graygoo.322.b: "Little Grey is so lewd, and so good~"
  gts_evt_graygoo.323.name: "Stuffed into Little Grey's Honey Hole"
  gts_evt_graygoo.323.desc: "'Boss... do you really want to do this?'\n\nLittle Grey replied with a shy face. The fleet watched the huge girl suddenly become coy, gazing at them with a blushing face. They felt especially humiliated and launched a new round of attacks towards Little Grey.\n\n'If boss wants to see it, Little Grey will do it.'\n\nLittle Grey wriggled her body, shamefully removing the nanomachines between her legs. Given her celestial size, Little Grey's genitals secreted a few drops of love juice, but these drops of love juice were capable of replacing the oceans of a planet and terraforming the environment. Arousing scents emerged along with the love juice. Some people in the fleet even began masturbating, fainting happily in Little Grey's aura.\n\nLittle Grey's exposure of her private parts made the fleet think they saw a chance. They all rushed forward at top speed, trying to damage Little Grey's hole.\n\n'Ugh... Do you know what you're doing!'\n\nThe fleet mistakenly took Little Grey's shyness as an indication their attacks were working, and they showered her with attacks using even denser firepower, nearly depleting all the energy of their ships, but this only made the tender opening of her hole wiggle a few times. In a moment, it returned to the way it was, releasing an intoxicating aura.\n\nPerhaps the fleet's relentless attacks made Little Grey feel pleasure, or perhaps Little Grey wanted to vent her desires. Little Grey stretched her slender fingers towards her private parts. When the fleet tried to dodge, they were crushed by Little Grey's fingers and turned into masturbation condiments. The wreckage of the fleet was absorbed by her fingers, reinforced by nanomachines, and sent into the soft flesh wall. The moist flesh walls tightly wrapped around the foreign objects, and the alloy of the ships was gradually deformed from the repeated squeezing of the crimson flesh wall. Even with the protection of the nanomachines, they could not survive this masturbation. The scraping of the alloy against the flesh wall made Little Grey feel an unusual pleasure. More and more love juice spilled out of her hole, washing over the still-surviving fleet like a massive tidal wave.\n\n'Mmm~ That feels good~'\n\nIt seemed like Little Grey's tolerance had reached its limit during her repeated insertion. As her fingers were fully inserted, a delicate moan entered everyone's ears. Love juice gushed out like a great flood, easily destroying the fleet's energy shields and armors. The crew were drowned by the boundless sea of love juice and died in this intoxicating aura, but even more love juice was constantly gushing out as if trying to fill the entire star system before stopping...\n\nLooking at the love juice gradually solidifying and forming new primitive celestial bodies in the cold universe, perhaps a new nanobot life will be born in this star system in the distant future. For now, Little Grey shyly called upon the nanomachines and resumed her usual pose. What should be done with all of this love juice (nanobots)?"
  gts_evt_graygoo.323.a: "Let Little Grey recycle them herself."
  gts_evt_graygoo.323.b: "Let them stay there."
  gts_evt_graygoo.324.name: "Little Grey's Jade Foot Trampling"
  gts_evt_graygoo.324.desc: "The nanomachines that made up Little Grey's boots turned into gray dust, scattered in the boundless universe, revealing her tender little feet wearing white silk. Her round toes slowly curled upward, as if showing off her perfect curves, along with her white silk feet, came a strong odor. Although Little Grey is a nanomachine aggregate, in order to improve the effect of this execution, Little Grey created a small amount of foot sweat for herself, and with the blessing of her celestial size, the odor generated was enough to kill all biological life. Thanks to the ships' air purification systems, the crew members did not die immediately; instead, they were wrapped in a strong smell. The strong sole stench was being circulated throughout their ship. Shields and armor were quickly broken down by the foot sweat, and even the interior of the ships had a light mist of foot sweat and foot odor, and soon crew members began to collapse.\n\n'What is this? It doesn't smell that bad, you are not supposed to slander people like that'\n\nIt was as if she wanted to prove her point, so Little Grey moved her little feet closer to the fleet. The sudden sharp increase in odor caused the air purification system to completely malfunction. A large number of crew members fainted due to the overpowering foot odor because they were almost suffocating. Even the few crew members that were still conscious had completely lost their desire to resist. They were simply looking blankly at Little Grey's white silk, waiting for their death to come. There were even some people who chose to kneel down and worship Little Grey as their goddess. Little Grey looked at the few people and tilted her head. Her white silk little feet were wriggling excitedly, adding a touch of innocence and loveliness to Little Grey.\n\n'See, my feet don't smell that badly. However, as punishment for being dishonest, you will be punished properly!'\n\nLittle Grey adjusted her posture slowly and placed her two little feet on both sides of the fleet. In the process, she destroyed a number of innocent asteroids. The strong odor further diffused into the star system and polluted the atmosphere of habitable planets. If the species on those planets didn't adapt to toxic substances, they would probably suffer a major extinction event. Little Grey, the culprit, stared at the fleet between her two feet like a cute child, looking at them as if they were toys.\n\nThe fleet began to retreat when Little Grey began to adjust her posture, but the huge difference in size meant that they could not even escape from the soles of Little Grey's feet.\n\n'If you make a mistake you shouldn't run away from the consequences, do you think you can escape?'\n\nLittle Grey's feet slowly closed together. The two huge white walls covered the vast area and slowly closed in on the fleet within it. Her ever-wriggling toes expressed the uncontrollable excitement of their owner. Before the ships made contact with her feet, their alloy armour was destroyed by the huge pressure generated by the movement of her foot. Only shattered alloy pieces remained on the smooth soles, becoming proof that they had once existed, the two giant walls collided with each other rapidly, despite being in the vacuum of space, the collision of Little Grey's white silk feet generated a huge amount of energy. It was nearly audible all the way to the furthest point away from the star. After Little Grey brought her two feet together, in order to clean the remaining alloys, or perhaps just purely to humiliate fleet that was stuck to her feet, she rubbed her two white silk feet together. The destructive power was only used to satisfy Little Grey's whim and the alloys stuck on her feet were further compressed by the process, becoming an extremely dense matter that could not be achieved through conventional technology, and were finally broken down by the nanomachines to become a part of Little Grey's clean white silk. The existence of the fleet was completely erased and no traces of them remained on Little Grey.\n\nThere were still some ships that were closer to the back that had survived Little Grey's crushing. They had thought that they had escaped danger, but they never imagined their being alive was just because Little Grey had become playful.\n\n'Looks like there are some survivors.'\n\nLittle Grey gently bent down, took off her thigh-high white stockings, and her elegant movements couldn't help making people lose themselves in them, but the remaining ships weren't in the mood to admire. Instead, they were trying their best to escape. Little Grey watched her slow acceleration, allowing the tormented crew members on the ships to easily escape. As they were just about to enter hyperspace, she put the opening of her white stockings in front of the ships. The ships that were originally about to leave the star system found themselves sucked into the white silk because of Little Grey's interference.  The strong foot odor and sweat made the crew members faint instantly, but the nanomachines forcibly kept them conscious, so they could better experience the punishment that was about to come.\n\n'Yay! The score is now 1:0!'\n\nLittle Grey happily shook the white silk in her hands, as if displaying a trophy.\n\n'If you want to leave, you must try harder'\n\nThe original fleet that had separated into several directions all ended up being easily caught by Little Grey as they were about to leave. Some of them couldn't even slow down and crashed into the soft white silk.\n\n'The score is now 31:0. The game is over. Now it is time for the losers to be punished.'\n\nIn Little Grey's stocking, the ships were firmly controlled by nanomachines. The crew members stared blankly at the opening of the stocking, waiting for their fate. Little Grey's five round toes were first detected by the radar, and then it was the boundless sole of her foot. Upon contact, Little Grey excitedly curled her toes, her round toes completely enveloping the ships, crushing it and her immaculate soles gradually descended, and she repeatedly compressed the last remaining space with her planet-sized toes, and crushed most of the ships. A few drops of foot sweat dripped down at an inopportune time, completely wrapping the remaining ships, and becoming an insignificant stain within Little Grey's white silk. After this torment, perhaps death was the best relief for them.\n\n'So boss, do you want to try it too? It's very comfortable and has not received any bad reviews yet! 'awa!'\n\nLittle Grey smiled and held up her white silk foot for §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§!, her wiggling toes were enough to convey her excitement. So..."
  gts_evt_graygoo.324.a: "Since Little Grey suggested it, let's give it a try."
  gts_evt_graygoo.3241.name: "Little Grey's City in Stocking"
  gts_evt_graygoo.3241.desc: "Little Grey's boots transformed into a gray mist, revealing her tender little feet wearing white silk, fragrant aromas dissipated around, and the arousing scents continued to spread, making one unable to stop themselves and making the faith in Little Grey even stronger on the planet. Little Grey moved her palm over §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§!, and the blue sky was instantly filled by her white hand. The faint blush was like a different terrain. The patterns on her palm divided this 'continent', and each pattern seemed capable of accommodating a large number of cities to provide a vast space for the little people to live in.  §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§!, looked helplessly at Little Grey's hand that was high above in the atmosphere. When she was about to board a ship, Little Grey's finger curled slightly. Her slender finger, which could destroy the continent, broke through the atmosphere, and moved quickly towards §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§!, as if to destroy the entire planet. \n\nAlong with a loud noise and strong tremors, two fingers touched the surface of the planet. All things, whether lofty peaks, lush forests, or bustling cities, were equally crushed by two towering white pillars, that formed two huge basins. Dense rock formed at the bottom and a small amount of sweat gradually collected to form small lakes in the basins, which would likely become the holy places for Little Grey's worshippers in the future. Little Grey's fingernails further penetrated deep, passed through the extremely hard rocks, and made direct contact with molten lava. At edge of contact, some of the magma had already overflowed. The massive earthquake caused by the contact almost completely destroyed the cities of the entire continent. The vast continent was filled with deep, bottomless ravines, making it easier to exploit minerals. \n\nLittle Grey's fingertip curled again and dug up the entire city where §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! was located. A large amount of magma erupted from the ground, the scale of which surpassed any previous volcanic eruption. If viewed from space, it would be like an apple that had had a bite taken out of it. Suffering Little Grey's abuse. at the cost of the death of hundreds of millions of people,  §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! was sent to the opening of Little Grey's stocking by Little Grey.\n\n'Since boss is experiencing it, you should enjoy the best service.'\n\nLittle Grey put the land she dug out into her white silk. The mist formed by wet foot sweat surrounded §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! and the fragrant aroma grew more intense. Although it was just Little Grey's sock, the space inside it seemed endless. It was as vast as the pitch-black universe. \n\nFive round toes appeared at the opening of the socks. The crystal clear sweat sprinkled on them made them even more perfect, resembling a work of art. Her toes were quickly approaching and the patterns on them were becoming clearer and clearer. It was as if you could also see the wreckage of cities that were left behind in the foot patterns of her toes and the little people she was breeding her on her fingertips along with it . As her huge toes approached, the tremendous power was making countless structures begin to levitate off the planet like the pull of gravity was no longer the same. Those structures went spiraling into the air and collided with Little Grey's fragrant foot sweat, mixing to become new foot filth. The moment the soft toes touched the city, the rigid structures could no longer withstand the tremendous pressure, and became the new wreckage on Little Grey's little feet. §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! was wrapped in the soft flesh of her foot and together with the city were left to be carelessly trampled within the white silk. The heavy pressure of crushing buildings did not come, and rather, it was as comfortable as a massage, accompanied by the fragrance of foot sweat. §E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§! gradually fell asleep in her sleepiness ......\n\n'So what is Little Grey planning to do with the situation on this planet? After all, she is the governor of this planet and can't just sit back and do nothing, right?'\n\n§E[ROOT.Ruler.GetName]§!, after waking up, looked at the flushed Little Grey and couldn't help but wonder what Little Grey had done to her after she had fallen asleep......"

  gts_evt_graygoo.325.name: "Little Grey's Deodorant"
  gts_evt_graygoo.325.desc: "'You're all so fragile, you don't even qualify to be played with,'\n\nLittle Grey said as she looked at the ships that had long since ceased to exist in her fingertips, expressing her dissatisfaction with the quality of the fleet. 'Useless lives like these should always remain in Little Grey's shoes.'\n\nLittle Grey carelessly humiliated the massive fleet in front of her, and after hearing such an insult, their commander ordered the fleet to launch a new round of attacks. \n\nWatching the stars slowly gather again and get closer and closer to her, a mischievous smile crept onto the angelic face of Little Grey, and the crew realized that something was wrong, but Little Grey's massive body made both attacking and retreating a pipe dream. Little Grey carefully supported her black boots and her smooth thigh gradually lifted, and her white silk feet, which had been encased in her long black boots, saw the light of day again.  A strong foot odor instantly diffused, making one wonder just how strong the smell inside her boots was.  Her round toes and smooth arches curved slightly, as if celebrating the joy of seeing the light of day again, but Little Grey was not planning to crush them with her little feet. Instead, she looked at the boots, which were still emitting heat and a strong odor, and revealed a malicious smile. \n\nThe fleet immediately scattered, as if trying to use the speed of their engines to avoid the massive girl's 'capture', but their speed seemed as if they were motionless and naturally they could not escape, and in Little Grey's eyes even moving an inch was an impossible task.  Little Grey laid her boots horizontally, and aimed the black hole-like opening at the still-assembled fleet.  The sweat and the fear of facing the giant object constantly gushing out from the boots made the crew suffer both mentally and physically, even the psychologically fragile crew members directly fainted. Whether it was from the foot sweat's smell or the pressure from the shoe opening, countless crew members knelt and bowed before Little Grey begging for her leniency , but Little Grey's smile did not diminish. Instead, she looked at the gradually collapsing fleet with greater playfulness. \n\n'Why don't you help me with something? If you do, I'll let you leave.'\n\nThis undoubtedly gave the collapsing crew a glimmer of hope. They weren't worried about whether Little Grey would break her promise. Just to give themselves a little bit of hope for survival, the commander did not even ask what it was and hurriedly agreed. \n\n'Very proactive. What you'll have to do is clean my foot filth for me. You should be able to accomplish that, right~?'\n\nThe ‘black hole’ rapidly moved towards them, from pure darkness they came to another space of darkness, and the strong foot odor had almost taken a physical form , the lingering foot sweat repeatedly washed over the ships like a tide. This all impacted the crew, further reducing their already small amount of remaining sanity . Once the 'capture' was complete, the fleet had been sent to the bottom of Little Grey's boots. And after being herded into the boot, it was only then that they felt just how difficult the task was -- the foot filth that piled up on the bottom of her shoe was as big as a continents and no matter how high the quality of weapons was, it was unable to move it in the slightest. \n\n'Seems like you're not willing to help, right? Do you want me to help you?'\n\nWithout giving her 'helpers' a choice, Little Grey put her white silk feet back into the boots. Her immaculate silk-encased feet enveloped all the ships and pushed them into the foot filth at the bottom of the boot. But the crew were encased within nanomachines; they were able to survive the massive pressure and could only passively bear the crushing weight of Little Grey's white silk feet. They were forced to constantly breathe in the dense foot odor. Having lost the only weapons that they can rely on, cleaning the continent-like foot filth became even more impossible. Only during the brief moment when Little Grey's little feet left the bottom of the boot were they able to be able to relax from the enormous pressure. They slowly cleaned the mountain of foot filth like microorganisms, in endless pain, while becoming Little Grey's foot bugs ......"

  gts_evt_graygoo.326.name: "Little Grey's Cock Trampling"
  gts_evt_graygoo.326.desc: "The nanomachines between Little Grey's legs have completely dispersed, turning into a gray mist floating around. The behemoth below her waist was able to truly expose itself in the vacuum, displaying its grandness. The scent of male hormones instantly swept through the entire star system. Crew members nearby felt nauseous and vomited because of the disgusting smell, while others had been assimilated by the obscene scent, and they started to masturbate in this aphrodisiac effect. Even before it was fully erect, Little Grey's huge root was a frightening length. The two testicles were like satellites, constantly producing the semen needed for the following masturbation. As Little Grey slowly stroked, the length of the behemoth below her waist gradually increased. A large amount of pre-ejaculate continuously oozed from the pink glans. The pre-ejaculate lubricated the head of the shaft and also enhanced its obscene aura and sparkled like a gemstone under the light of the star.\n\nHer pink shaft was fully erect. Little Grey stopped stroking for a moment, as if to pursue even greater pleasure. Little Grey grabbed the ships that were still around and moved them in front of her 'horse eye' When the dizzy crew regained consciousness, in front of them were only a dark hole and a scarlet monstrosity. When they faced the shaft that was constantly oozing aphrodisiac fluids,  the fleet's valiant attacks could not leave a mark. They were not even able to break free from Little Grey's fingers even when they accelerated their engines to maximum power. In despair, the crew stretched their hands downwards, beginning to masturbate following their body's instincts.\n\nThe ships were suddenly released by Little Grey. The maximum power of the engines sent them flying forward like arrows towards the dark hole. Little Grey took control of everything on the ships with the help of nanomachines, allowing them to overcome the obstruction from the pre-ejaculate and enter the scarlet beast. Before the commander could feel lucky to not have died, he was surprised to find that he had lost all control of the ship. All the weapons on the ship were activated at the same time and began shooting at the dark red walls all around. \n\n'Hmm~ the little people are trying hard'\n\nFeeling the waves of stimulation from her penis, Little Grey's face became flushed.  Her already stiff cock seemed even harder, and expressed its desire for pleasure through trembling slightly. \n\n'Although I can only feel it even after amplifying the sensation many times ...'\n\nLittle Grey's pink hands were on the shaft, quickly masturbating . The frequency of the pulsations grew more and more rapid, and the unfortunate ships, trapped inside the urethra, broke down in the repeated contact with the flesh walls. Along with Little Grey’s moan, a large amount of white viscous fluid along with the crystal clear pre-ejaculate shot out from the ‘horse eye’ and floated to the fleet in the distance. Regardless of their resistance, they could not change their fate, and were swallowed by a tidal wave. The foul-smelling semen filled every corner of the ships. The huge sperms even targeted the ships as if attempting fertilization, further destroying the already damaged fleet. \n\nAfter a long time, Little Grey's ejaculation finally ended. Her still-erect penis seemed to yearn for more pleasure. She gently wiped away the remaining semen on her rosy shaft as if recalling the pleasure of ejaculation. A massive semen sphere formed by nanobots had formed in the star system and no matter what type of organism, it could not survive in it, and it had become a dead zone in the star system..."

  ### Army Events ###
  gts_evt_graygoo.40.name: "Little Grey's Planetary Invasion"
  gts_evt_graygoo.40.desc: "Little Grey appeared on the invaded planet at 10 times her size. A few small people hadn't yet understood what was happening before being crushed under her huge boots. Cracks began to appear in the streets, and small people cursed the inactive army, crazily looking for transportation, causing many traffic accidents and making escape even more difficult. This city was one of the most prosperous metropolises on the planet, and the density and number of buildings far exceeded other regions, forming a vast urban area. Understandably, it became Little Grey's top priority, and she began her planetary invasion here.\n\nLittle Grey's massive body began to move, completely ignoring the situation of the small people underfoot. Each time her boots landed, they left behind bloody shoeprints in the crowded streets. Little Grey, as if taking a stroll, easily and pleasurably enjoyed the prosperity of the city, and she was completely unconcerned by the cruel slaughter beneath her feet.  More and more small people had hidden in the shops along the road, hoping that Little Grey would not find them, When the sound of footsteps gradually stopped, the small people who had finally started to relax looked out the door, only for a pair of azure eyes to look back at them from under the glass door. The small people suddenly panicked and ran aimlessly, even rushing out of the shop, and were crushed into the street by the blood-stained soles of Little Grey's white silk boots while in terror.\n\n'So many people are hiding inside; I can't let them go.'\n\nAfter stepping on a few small people that rushed out, Little Grey pressed her boots against the glass door, and cracks immediately appeared all over the original smooth glass. \n\n'Ah this is just a right size. Goodbye little people inside.'\n\nThe black boots easily broke through the resistance and crushed the small people in the shop together with all of the merchandise. \n\nThe grey mist gradually approached Little Grey. The small people who were in the high-rise buildings watched Little Grey gradually become larger, eventually towering over the top of the building. \n\n'This is just about the right size.'\n\nLittle Grey stretched out her arms lazily, showing off her beautiful body curves to the small people in the sunlight. The imprint of her deep footprints had sunk into the road surface. More and more small people were panicking and had become decoration in the bloodied shoe sole, A vehicle full of small people attracted Little Grey's attention.  Her boots hung in the air above the vehicle, and the inside was instantly plunged into darkness. As the foot landed, the vehicle accelerated and burst out of the range of the sole of Little Grey's foot.  Little Grey only kept stepping on the vehicle as it moved. Countless numbers of small people were caught in the chase and became the filth on the bottom of Little Grey's feet. While the small people were rejoicing at having escaped the stomp, the vehicle suddenly crashed into a large black object. The small people fell to the ground, and looking up, they saw that Little Grey's little feet were blocking the road in front of them, preventing their escape. As usual, the other foot hovered in the air above the vehicle.  And there was no chance for the vehicle to drive out from underneath the sole of the foot now that it had been pressed into a piece of metal by her hard shoe.\n\n'They've gone quite far, haven't they?'\n\nLooking at the massive footprints that were left where the vehicle was chased and at the red dots that were once small people, Little Grey felt no remorse and instead began searching for new toys to continue her fun\n\n'Can the small people in the buildings over there see me?  Can I please touch you? ' Little Grey stretched out her fingers towards a glass building. The design that was originally for lighting and views gave the small people a full perspective of the giant body that was now towering in front of their eyes and it further intensified the small people's fear. The glass shattered as soon as her fingers touched the building.  The small people near the windows were also pierced by broken glass shards. Little Grey's fingers approached the slumped small people, and she gently put her fingers on them, but even her such gentle movement broke their body apart becoming tiny red dots on her fingertips.\n\n'Why are you so weak? You can't even let me play with you? You're truly useless.'\n\n"

  gts_evt_graygoo.40.desc.futa: "$gts_evt_graygoo.40.desc$\n\nLooking at the building that was as tall as her, the nanomachines between Little Grey's legs disappeared revealing the erect shaft. The overflowing pre-ejaculate had already lubricated it. Slight throbbing announced the desire for pleasure. Little Grey held her shaft and aimed it at the building, forcefully penetrating it. The shattered glass and the corpses of small people collided on the pink glans as if to make it harder. As she was about to pierce through the building, Little Grey gently moved up her shaft, crushing the several floors using her white foreskin. As the shaft tilted slightly and stood upright within the broken building, the debris that was gradually breaking off fell into her 'horse eye' And the small people on her shaft were desperately struggling 'Hmm~ that's more like it~'\n\nFeeling the pleasure transmitted by her shaft, Little Grey's face was flushed. Her already erect shaft seemed even harder. Through tiny tremors her shaft expressed her cravings for more pleasure.\n\n'I feel so much better, after amplifying the feeling many times over...'\n\nLittle Grey's pink hand supported her shaft, masturbating quickly. The rate of her shaft's pulsations was becoming quicker and quicker.  A rumbling sound was constantly coming from her crimson-colored abyss.  Semen flowed out like a flood towards the shopping center. But the small people had already lost themselves under the effects of the aphrodisiac gas. They were competing with one another to rush to the raging white flood to try for contact with the semen. The originally bustling commercial district had been turned into a white lake and had become a new landmark for the city."

  gts_evt_graygoo.41.name: "Little Grey's Planetary Invasion"
  gts_evt_graygoo.41.desc: "Feeling her ever-more comfortable body size, the buildings that were originally the same height as Little Grey were now only the size of her toes, not even comparable to the soles of her boots. Looking at the spire that was higher than the other buildings in the distance, Little Grey slowly walked over. Through the horrified expressions of the small people below, she exposed her tender ‘honey hole’.  A few drops of love juice fell as if to celebrate the following pleasure. The pink flesh wall fell slowly and consumed the top of the red spire. More and more love juice flowed down along the steel reinforcement bars. The pink flesh hole completely wrapped the spire and turned it into a useless piece of metal after squeezing down on it.  Little Grey was now sitting in the middle of the city, currently thinking about how to have fun next.  She glimpsed a few black dots in the distance. Some time later, the army had finally arrived!   But they were only going to provide some seasonings for the following entertainment. Ground forces poured firepower on the boots, and after the rolling smoke had cleared away, they could see Little Grey impatiently lift her foot above the army and then slam it down hard. A large part of the army had been instantly killed or wounded. Little Grey pressed her foot down and rubbed it on the ground several times, and looking at the scattered army, she slowly took off her boots, and threw them towards the army, completely cutting off their retreat. Even the small number of people who had luckily survived would still fall unconscious in the constant foul odor that was being emitted from the opening of the shoe. The planes had finally arrived above Little Grey and began to attack. Feeling her back itching, Little Grey impatiently lifted her head. The small people thought that Little Grey couldn't do anything to them and started cheering, waiting for the final support from the space fleet.\n\n'I can use flying artillery to get rid of these insects , but how about we switch to a more interesting method?'\n\nLittle Grey's already massive body expanded yet again. Several planes directly crashed into her soft skin and the rest were easily swatted down as if they were flies.\n\n'It's still much more convenient like this.'\n\nLittle Grey slightly curled her toes, and the buildings that were at the feet were pressed into the ground, leaving behind five unevenly-sized pits. The city where Little Grey was located had the largest business district in the world, contributing large a number of income for the empire, but the people in the giant shopping malls were in no mood to enjoy the pleasures of shopping.  Countless small people who were watching the two white pillars crushed the buildings along the route and approached them step by step all worshipped Little Grey as their goddess."
  gts_evt_graygoo.41.desc.normal: "$gts_evt_graygoo.41.desc$\n\nLittle Grey stopped not far from the mall, and she leaned over to examine the bustling business district, it seemed it were toys that met her requirements. Little Grey placed her palms on both sides of the shopping mall, and the white giants on her chest were also displayed. In the panicked eyes of the small people, the white sky was falling towards them. Valuable goods from various planets were crushed equally, and were buried under the hundred-meter deep milky scented basin along with the small people. Little Grey's breast completely touched the ground, and the collapse of the buildings was constantly stimulating Little Grey. Her breasts kept moving forward, crushing everything it was along the way like a road roller. In just a few seconds, this prosperous commercial district had been turned into nothing, and only several handprints and a huge basin filled with milk smell were left behind. "
  gts_evt_graygoo.41.desc.futa: "$gts_evt_graygoo.41.desc$\n\nLittle Grey stopped not far from the shopping center and leaned down to examine the prosperous business district. The small people's fear and worship gave Little Grey great pleasure. \n\n'Let's handle you in a different way'\n\nLittle Grey straightened her body; the shaft seemed even harder and larger. Her pink and white hands slowly stroked, and there was overflowing remnant semen from the last event oozing out and crashing into the small people below. Little Grey's face gradually flushed, her breathing quickened and the speed of her stroking quickened more,  and a rumbling sound was constantly coming from the dark red abyss.  Semen rushed into the shopping malls like a flood, and the small people had already lost themselves to the aphrodisiac gases. They were competing and rushing to the raging white flood in order to touch the semen. The once prosperous shopping mall had been turned into a white lake and had become a new landmark for the city.

It seems I have to grow a bit more.'\n\nThe white toes grew increasingly larger, and the shattered city was completely ground into powder. Her small white silk feet can destroy a city entirely in just a few steps and easily change the terrain, which has not changed for a million years. Even the highest mountains were forced to lay prostrate under Little Grey's feet, and were crushed under the ground. When carelessly crushing several cities, Little Grey had walked to the sea. She destroyed several small towns along the way. Once she reached the sea, she sat down in a small city. Her ample buttocks squished against the land, forming a new mountain range. Her legs covered with white silk stretched out. Because of the long period of being trampled, her soles were covered with city wreckage and mud. By mixing it with her foot sweat large clouds of mist were formed. \n\n'Let's use the ocean to clean a bit. I'm sure no one will mind, right?'\n\nHer white silk feet were placed into the ocean and instantly absorbed a large quantity of seawater. As Little Grey kept rubbing, the dirt came off of the white silk along with the city wreckage sinking to the seabed. The originally clear seawater became a cloudy mess, filled with the acidic smell of sweat.\n\n'Since there are still people who are not willing to surrender, let's just go directly to the final execution.'\n\nLittle Grey stood on the surface of the planet and a light leap was enough for her to break free of gravity. And in space, she restored her celestial size. How should she handle this tiny planet?"

The sky was replaced by gray, and even more Grey Goo kept arriving. The weapons of the remaining resistance forces could not affect the Grey Goo, but instead, provided energy for the replication of it. The only warships that had a chance of causing damage were also easily erased by the celestial Little Grey. Grey Goo instantly covered everything on the planet's surface. The hardened alloy was decomposed, and the vast ocean was replaced. Everything was turned into raw material for Grey Goo replication.\n\nThe Grey Goo continued the destruction deeper and deeper. Even the hard rock was decomposed in just a moment. The energy released by the hot magma would theoretically protect against the destruction, but the Grey Goo instead absorbed it and further accelerated its self replication. The liquid mantle was quickly destroyed, and the Grey Goo had already reached the core of the planet - the core of the earth, which had a very high density due to hundreds of millions of years of accumulation. However for the Grey Goo, it was only a few moments of contact before they decomposed part of the core. The heart of the planet became nourishment for the Grey Goo's growth, and became a part of Little Grey. \n\nThis planet has become a nano planet; the nanomachines that flow like the sea appeared to have a life of their own, and the constantly changing atmosphere and terrain was in an extremely unstable state, no longer suitable for any life to inhabit. Even hardened alloy would decompose under the effect of the nanomachines. The true hell on earth was nothing more than this......"
