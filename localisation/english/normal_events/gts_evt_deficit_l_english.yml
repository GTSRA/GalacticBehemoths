  gts_evt_deficit.1.name: "First Contact"
  gts_evt_deficit.1.desc: "Through tireless efforts from both sides, we have connected to each other's communication channels. Witnessed by numerous media outlets, our scientists made the first call to their inner world. Though both sides were nervous during the few minutes of conversation, the outcome was quite successful. Both parties expressed a desire for a peaceful resolution, and media coverage has further swayed public opinion towards harmonious coexistence."
  gts_evt_deficit.1.a: "This is a good opportunity to negotiate with them"
  gts_evt_deficit.1.b: "This is a good opportunity to negotiate with her"
  gts_evt_deficit.2.name: "Cultural Bloodline"
  gts_evt_deficit.2.desc: "Some of our scientists have proposed unique perspectives amidst the unsettled public opinion. They believe these discovered tinies possess highly organized social structures and advanced technology, possibly explaining the mystery of how our species evolved from savagery to intelligence within millennia. Completely expelling the tinies might bring unknown consequences to our species' health. Furthermore, enthusiasts of giantess culture have started creating works inspired by this event, attracting substantial market interest."
  gts_evt_deficit.2.a: "Perhaps the situation may improve?"
  gts_evt_deficit.2.b: "Perhaps the situation may improve?"
  gts_evt_deficit.3.name: "Spread of Unease"
  gts_evt_deficit.3.desc: "The fact that our bodies host a group of intelligent life forms is shocking in itself, and rumors and media sensationalism have quickly turned this emotion negative. The unsettling thought of being mere puppets to microscopic creatures spreads like wildfire. It's crucial whether the governments will go along with or counter this trend."
  gts_evt_deficit.3.a: "Have all leaders undergo inspections!"
  gts_evt_deficit.3.b: "Show these nonsense-spouting bastards some consequences!"
  gts_evt_deficit.4.name: "Escalating Panic"
  gts_evt_deficit.4.desc: "Public anxiety over the tinies within our bodies has further escalated, with cases of injuries from attempts to expel them already reported. Demonstrations demanding the government to promptly eradicate these parasites are on the rise. Leaders, medical personnel, and the military have secretly begun tiny removal surgeries, indicating that the result of this crisis is becoming evident."
  gts_evt_deficit.4.a: "Prepare to take action"
  gts_evt_deficit.4.b: "At worst, we'll go down fighting!"
  gts_evt_deficit.6.name: "Cleansing Operation"
  gts_evt_deficit.6.desc: "The conflict has reached its peak, and this morning, the giantess government issued a comprehensive cleansing order against the parasitic species within. Medical teams are dispatched nationwide to promptly administer precise bactericidal injections to citizens affected by the 'pest infestation.' Given that the tinies have no effective countermeasures other than attempting to go down with the giantess by detonating bombs, their complete eradication is likely just a matter of time."
  gts_evt_deficit.6.a: "We've finally reclaimed our bodily sovereignty from the bugs!"
  gts_evt_deficit.6.b: "You shall pay the consequences!"
  gts_evt_deficit.5.name: "Peace Negotiations"
  gts_evt_deficit.5.desc: "The cooperative attitude from both sides has fostered a suitable social environment for negotiations. This morning, the giantess government officially announced negotiations with the tiny government. Though the sight of giantess officials in a room negotiating with tinies living in their nether regions via comms projection is amusing, both sides reached a mutually satisfactory outcome: the giantesses will secretly assist the tinies in colonizing other species, while the tinies will dedicate most resources to maintaining giantess health and consider their government's advice when choosing colonization targets."
  gts_evt_deficit.5.a: "Let's have a pleasant cooperation with our tiny allies within!"
  gts_evt_deficit.5.b: "Our grand ambition moves forward!"
  Jiju_standard_on: "You can now quickly add the 'Miniature Lifeform Parasite' trait to other species by setting their citizenship to assimilation in the species interface."
  gts_evt_deficit.7.name: "Plugging the Leak"
  gts_evt_deficit.7.desc: "A private research agency named 'Supernatural Research Department' recently revealed their latest discovery-they completed a short-range time travel experiment. They claim they can achieve manned travel to the past to resolve our current energy crisis at its source with some funding from us, provided they choose the candidates, and we cannot inquire about the technology or purpose."
  gts_evt_deficit.7.a: "Worth a try"
  gts_evt_deficit.7.b: "No, we cannot gamble with our history"
  gts_evt_deficit.8.name: "Temporal Traverse"
  gts_evt_deficit.8.desc: "They finally prepared the transport ritual, led by their chief scientist with teal pigtails. After making final adjustments, the scientist vanished. Almost simultaneously, a vast amount of energy appeared in our treasury, indicating her promise was kept, though the potential impacts on our history remain unknown due to timeline changes."
  gts_evt_deficit.8.a: "At least we can solve the energy crisis now"
