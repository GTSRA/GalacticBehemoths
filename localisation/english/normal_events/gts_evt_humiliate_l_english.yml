  gts_evt_humiliate.1000.name: "Humiliation from a Girl"

  gts_evt_humiliate.1000.desc: "The girl's feet are a little cold, and then she sees §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!, smiling slightly. Her bare feet are twice the size of §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!, about 3 million kilometers.\n\nShe extends her foot and playfully presses the sole and top of her foot against §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!, squeezing.  The vacuum of space, normally silent, seems to echo with a rumbling roar, indicating that §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§! is groaning and shattering under the girl's foot. The scorching little ball that humanity relies on, that gives life to §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet_2.GetName]§!, now groans and distorts under her beautiful foot, like a soft cake being squeezed. Every movement of her toes causes the crushed and scattered rock layers to spread further into space.  One wonders if this squeezing can bring warmth to the girl-"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1010.name: "Humiliation from a Girl"

  gts_evt_humiliate.1010.desc: "The girl sitting on the continent of §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§! is millions of times larger than the §S[root.GetSpeciesName]§!. Her toes tower over the highest peaks, obscuring the horizon. At this scale, humans are no different from microorganisms. She sits on the ground, tilting her head as she looks at the land beneath her feet.\n\n'I wonder what I look like from your perspective~'\n\nBeneath the girl, the cracked earth's crust spreads destruction like a spiderweb, magma gurgling out and colliding with the ocean, creating the largest steam cloud in history.\n\n'I just thought of something interesting?'\n\nSeeing this, the girl suddenly has a mischievous idea. She extends her jade foot and places it in the ocean. The powerful absorbency of her socks instantly sucks up the seawater. The ocean's depth isn't even enough to submerge her foot, and half the ocean's water is nearly drained by her socks.  Then, she takes off her socks and stands up. Her snow-white jade feet stepping on the ground cause the entire planet to experience tremors exceeding magnitude 6.\n\n'It's hot for everyone on the planet, right? The goddess has come to cool you down-'\n\nThe girl takes a few steps and arrives at another continent. Looking at the cities below, she smiles, reaches out, and gently exerts force: Like the flood in the biblical story, a world-ending torrent pours down from the sky. Waves hundreds, thousands of meters high wash over the entire land. Humans are drowned in the torrential flood before they can even react, without any chance of resistance. A devilish smile appears on the girl's lips: 'This is just my foot-washing water. If you can't even resist something so weak, then you can only re-evolve, right? Start the origin of life again in my foot-washing water?'"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1020.name: "A Celestial Girl's Visit?"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1020.desc: "§S'Passing by another unique planet…'§!\n\nThe girl is just a passerby in the vast starry sea, simply happening upon an ordinary planet-§Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!\n\nThe girl's size is only about ten times larger than the planet. In front of the tiny, toy-like planet, the girl, nearly a billion times larger, smiles mischievously and looks down at the small mudball with disdain.\n\n§S'Is this… inhabited?'§!\n\nThe girl has been traveling in interstellar space for a while.  She wiggles her booted feet slightly, her toes fidgeting restlessly inside her boots.  She seems to want to do something to the planet in front of her.\n\n§S'Hmm… I just saw a new drink at a certain drink shop through the communicator~ It's just right for you microorganisms to drink~'§!\n\nThe girl's body, stretched out in the galaxy, bends slightly.  She lifts her right foot, pulls the zipper on the side of her boot, and gently pulls out her right foot, filled with a rich aroma, from the inside of the boot she hasn't cleaned since buying it.\n\nThanks to the lack of oxygen in space, the girl's gray cotton socks haven't further catalyzed during this interstellar journey.  Her right foot, slightly damp with sweat, only emits a faint sour smell.  Thanks to the full absorption of the cotton socks, there isn't a very strong smell between her round, plump toes.\n\nHowever, the slightly yellowed part of the sock where her foot rests suggests it's been a while.\n\n§S'This is a gift, you know~? Little ones~'§!\n\nThe girl pulls her socked foot completely out of her right boot. If it weren't for the vacuum, the little people would probably be completely overwhelmed by the pungent smell the moment they smelled the rich scent of her socks, forever masturbating in the aroma at the girl's feet, right?\n\n§S'I'll give it to you reluctantly~ Now everyone can enjoy the new drink~'§!"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1021.name: "A Celestial Girl's Visit?"

  gts_evt_humiliate.1021.desc: "The girl's right fingertips reach through the opening of her sock above her ankle. The mid-calf gray cotton socks paired with her short boots are easily pulled off. Debris stuck between her toes falls off as she wiggles them, clinging to the cotton threads of the socks.\n\n§S'Pfft… A planet not even as long as my sock…  Sigh~ I don't know whether to put the sock on the surface~ or just put you all inside my sock~'§!\n\nThe girl lifts the sock, emitting a strong foot odor, and casually straightens it, dangling it above §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!'s North Pole. The pungent foot odor is captured by the planet's gravity, completely filling §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!'s atmosphere.\n\nThe atmospheric composition of §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§! is almost entirely rewritten by the girl's single sock. Almost 80% of it is completely transformed into the smell of her gray cotton sock. And the girl, floating in space, holding her dirty gray cotton sock in one hand, has only held it above §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!'s North Pole for less than thirty seconds…\n\n§S'Oh dear~ Don't die from overexcitement in the smell of my socks before you even get a drink~?'§!\n\nThe girl covers her mouth and giggles, slightly disappointed by the planet's technological level. She lightly releases the hand holding the sock.\n\n§S'Alright~ It's yours~'§!\n\nThe sock, twice the length of §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!'s equator, falls due to gravity.  The toe, with the strongest odor, instantly plunges into the nearly melted North Pole glaciers.  The toe of the cotton sock is completely submerged in the Arctic Ocean, completely integrating the girl's scent into §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!'s water cycle.  The ball of the sock bends and folds, the fibers buckling under the weight of the sock.  The collapsing cotton threads show no signs of stopping, continuing to advance after crushing the countries around the North Pole into dust.  The death toll almost doubles-the countries covered by the sock's stains are almost completely wiped out, nearly hundreds of millions of people completely crushed by the foot part of the girl's sock, leaving only remnants of the knitted mesh. Even the cities that are relatively lucky cannot withstand the intense odor for more than a few seconds.  The lungs of the creatures called humans burn as if on fire, ultimately leading to the suffocating deaths of the 10% who survived under the sock, over fifty million people…\n\n§S'Phew… Be grateful~ to my socks~ Whether it's arousal~ or drinking the seawater soaked in my socks~ This is the best gift this goddess can give to you primitives~'§!\n\nThe girl puts on her boots and continues her distant interstellar journey.  She doesn't care that her right foot is missing a sock.  But a certain planet in the vast starry sea seems to have to care a great deal…"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1030.name: "The Girl Who Crushes the Setting Sun"

  gts_evt_humiliate.1030.desc: "I crushed the setting sun, with my foot, you know?  Mmm… Mr. Sun, being trampled under my bare feet, do you feel the difference in power?\n\nI lightly step onto the edge of the sun with my bare foot, my toes curling as I playfully toy with this tiny, insignificant star, as if I were manipulating a helpless little bug.\n\nHee hee~ The sun distorts further under my toes, violently kneaded into countless fragments.\n\nOn distant Earth, the sky has darkened.  It hasn't been destroyed by the aftershocks of the explosion because I gently inhaled and sucked all the explosions in.\n\nLook, look, I've even changed the color of the sky~  The sky, the ground, and you tiny mortals, are you all trembling?"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1040.name: "Girl's City Trampling"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1040.desc: "These large feet crush back and forth in the bustling city center, twisting her round, plump toes as she smashes the tops of buildings, raining death down upon the fleeing little people: shattered rubble, various furniture and decorations spilling from collapsing buildings, small, colorful cars flattened into thin sheets… all fall clattering from the gaps between her wiggling toes, crushing the fleeing little people to death before her feet even land.\n\nThe next second, her toes touch down, pressing the towering cityscape into four long and short gaps, then dragging and grinding forward, catching up with those pitiful little people who couldn't even escape the width of her toenail, crushing them along with their homes and lives. The gaps behind her, overflowing with earth, rocks, and debris, grow longer and longer as the ground trembles.  Everything in front of her, living or not, tall or short, is knocked down and crushed, pressed into the ground to form new, multicolored strata. Her playful toes lift slightly, as if to clean the debris between them, rubbing against the ground. A whole row of high-rise apartments, along with the residents who couldn't escape in time, are instantly mashed into a heap of uneven, crumbling debris, perfectly imprinted with the shape of her toe pads and the roundness of the front of her foot.\n\nHer foot then plants firmly on the ground, collapsing almost all the surrounding buildings that can barely maintain their verticality. Thousands of people are knocked to the ground by the shockwave, some even bleeding from their seven orifices and dying.\n\nAs if this wasn't despairing enough, the other giant foot, planted in a distant urban area, arrives above the bustling commercial district with a powerful wind pressure strong enough to blow away the little people, even shattering a few news helicopters like dust against her toes along the way, unnoticed by the owner of these large feet. She simply raises her eyes, looking down upon the chaotic mudflow of humanity, enjoying their despair, calculating when to end their lives. After all, the things these humans treasure are nothing but dust in her eyes…"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1041.name: "Girl's City Trampling"

  gts_evt_humiliate.1041.desc: "At this time, her stomach rumbles with a startling growl, expressing her hunger. Completely ignoring the terrified teacher and the scattered students trying to escape, she apologizes as she walks towards the cafeteria. The old teaching building in her path has a corner smashed by her giant loafers. Desks, chairs, and benches clatter down from the third floor to the first, falling on those fortunate students who weren't crushed to death by the tip of her shoes, eliciting cries of pain.\n\nShe completely ignores the senior's shouts, her next step landing among the scattering, fleeing students, incidentally knocking down a row of parasol trees and crushing a few unlucky students.\n\nBefore these poor children have a chance to scream or cry for help, the shiny black loafer on her right foot replaces their place in the world."
  gts_evt_humiliate.1050.name: "[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_leader.GetName]'s Prank"
  gts_evt_humiliate.1050.desc: "Recently, §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§! welcomed the harvest season. Large quantities of crops were packed and organized into boxes by high-tech harvesters. As our staff were inspecting the results, the sunlight suddenly disappeared, and strong winds swept across, overturning the collected food and the machines working in the fields.\n\n'This must be §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!, right? The ground here is a different color.'\n\nAppearing on §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§! is §H[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_leader.GetName]§!. As the girl's giant face approaches, the blush on her cheeks shines through the clouds…  Her beautiful face reveals a hint of mischief, as if she has some ulterior motive for this farmland…\n\n'Hey… the little moss here looks glittery… Everyone must have put in a lot of effort… It's a remarkable achievement for little bugs… I've always been curious about what these locally produced foods taste like.'\n\nBy the time we realized something was wrong, it was already too late. §H[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_leader.GetName]§! slowly opens her slightly pink lips, her pink tongue swirling with steam, and slams it towards §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!. The poor residents and workers don't even have time to react before they are stuck in the taste bud folds of §H[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_leader.GetName]§!'s tongue, becoming part of this 'feast.' As the giant wall of flesh slowly advances, bridges, farmlands, fortresses, machinery, everything people have built is crushed and deformed, becoming consumables for the girl's curiosity.\n\n'Mmm… These golden crumbs taste much better than those gray lichens. She was right…' \n\nAs the pink mountain of flesh deftly scoops up the facilities on the ground and brings them back up into the air for a closer taste, a gentle smile appears on the girl's face, and she leaves, satisfied.\n\nWhen the sun's light once again falls upon §Y[event_target:gts_humiliate_targert_planet.GetName]§!, all that remains is lifeless rocky ground. Mottled dust and lakes of dripping saliva reshape the planet's surface. Now there's no sign of any agricultural production base; instead, it resembles a dead star."
  gts_evt_humiliate.1050.a: "Perhaps we should make them more comfortable."
  gts_evt_humiliate.1050.b: "Nothing to be done."
