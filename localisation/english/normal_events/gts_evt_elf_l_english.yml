  gts_evt_elf.10.name: "Communication Link"
  gts_evt_elf.10.desc: "This is the first and final warning, stranger. Leave our territory immediately; outsiders are never welcome here. If you dare trespass into our forbidden lands, destruction awaits you. Also, stop leering at us in that lecherous way. It's quite disgusting."

  gts_evt_elf.11.name: "Secret Visit"
  gts_evt_elf.11.desc: "Our border outpost facing the direction of the Treant Elves has detected a simple civilian ship without interstellar sovereignty markings speeding toward us. It's repeatedly sending communication requests. Upon connection, our diplomat recognizes her immediately, it's §YTiffany§! - the princess of the Treant Elf Kingdom.\n\nThe station's attack preparations and hyperspeed barriers have been lifted, and the communication is now transferred to us."
  gts_evt_elf.11.a: "Connect Communications"
  gts_evt_elf.12.name: "Tiffany"
  gts_evt_elf.12.desc: "Uh, is it connected? Oh, good. Hello, I am Tiffany, the crown princess of the Treant Elves. I know our nations haven't had much interaction since establishing relations, but I'm fascinated by your civilization, so I've visited in a personal capacity!"
  gts_evt_elf.12.a: "Did you sneak out?"
  gts_evt_elf.12.a.respond: "Wha... what do you mean sneak out!?\n\n...Alright, I did sneak out. My mother forbid us from contacting alien species for our safety and enforced a frugal lifestyle to sustain our massive group. But I've always believed isolation is not sustainable, and your diverse culture intrigued me. Even with the risk of punishment, I had to come see!\n\nSo, will you take me in?"
  gts_evt_elf.12.b: "Welcome, we are glad to have you visit our nation."
  gts_evt_elf.12.b.respond: "Great... it was all worth it!\n\nWe have no civilian ships capable of interstellar travel in our nation. You can't imagine how many tiny pirates and merchants I had to catch to piece this ship together."
  gts_evt_elf.12.c: "No, we cannot risk angering your nation."
  gts_evt_elf.12.c.respond: "But... but...\n\nAlright, I thought your nation was brave and open-minded, so I invested so much effort... sigh. Nonetheless, my mission remains unchanged. If you don't welcome me, I'll find a nation that does!"
  gts_evt_elf.13.name: "Emergency Comms"
  gts_evt_elf.13.desc: "The dedicated communication channel between us and the Treant Elves, unused since establishing ties, suddenly blares. It seems they've focused their suspicion on us after a comprehensive search."
  gts_evt_elf.14.desc: "You kidnappers! Isn't creating your own mess and chaos enough that now you wish to bring calamity to us?\n\nOur love of peace doesn't mean we have no limits. Return our princess at once, or we'll go down with you!"
  gts_evt_elf.14.a: "Your princess joined us willingly"
  gts_evt_elf.14.a.respond: "What? That's impossible!\n\nOh no, why did the princess follow the assembly's nonsense...\n\nRegardless, the princess was enchanted into fleeing to your nation. I apologize for my earlier harsh words, but our demand remains unchanged. Return her immediately, or we will send forces to retrieve her, which might cause unnecessary casualties."
  gts_evt_elf.14.b: "Fine, we will send Tiffany back."
  gts_evt_elf.14.b.respond: "That's for the best. We don't wish for war either. Our escort fleet awaits at the border for you to send the princess. Don't try any tricks.\n\nI hope we never meet again."
  gts_evt_elf.14.c: "No, you can't force Tiffany to return."
  gts_evt_elf.15.desc: "Indeed, there seems to be no good in the galaxy. Our fleet will assemble, and you shall never earn our forgiveness!"
  Teifuania_leader: "Tiffany Westwood"
  Teifuania_leader_desc: "Tiffany Westwood, unlike other treant elves, is a giantess with curiosity about the outside world."
  Teifuania_catch_phrase: "Thank you very much! (She bows deeply, her enormous breasts shaking up and down. Noticing your gaze, she blushes and tries to shield her chest with her arms.)"
  gts_evt_elf.16.name: "Communication"
  gts_evt_elf.16.desc: "I'm surprised you stood up to them. Even if it's just one star system, our navy is strong, you know.\n\nThank you; coming to you was the right choice.\n\nAllow me to introduce myself formally again. My name is §YTiffany Westwood§!, crown princess of the Treant Elf Kingdom... although I feel my mother might not acknowledge my status anymore."
  gts_evt_elf.16.a: "What will happen if your nation declares war on us?"
  gts_evt_elf.16.a.respond: "I'm not sure. We do have many ships, but our military is designed for defense. Once my mother calms down, she shouldn't forsake all treant elves just to retaliate."
  gts_evt_elf.16.b: "What can you do?"
  gts_evt_elf.16.b.respond: "Thanks to mother's education and my local work experience in the Treant Kingdom, I'm confident in finance management and reducing waste, like cutting down on tinies for personal amusement and downsizing city production to use regular devices... Oh, is that not okay? Why?"
  gts_evt_elf.16.c.respond: "Thank you very much!\n\n§H(She bows deeply, her enormous breasts shake up and down. Catching her gaze, you realize you've been staring at her chest for several minutes.)§!\n\nWhat a perverted guy...\n\n§H(She blushes, trying to shield her chest with her arms.)§!"
  gts_evt_elf.17.name: "Restored Communications"
  gts_evt_elf.17.desc: "The dedicated communication channel between us and the Treant Elves has received a message. Let's hope they don't blame us for their princess's disappearance."
  gts_evt_elf.18.name: "Sharul"
  gts_evt_elf.18.desc: "I'm Sharul, the queen of the Treant Elves. A month ago, my daughter tried to flee to your nation. You wisely declined her naive request. She has been returned and is currently serving punishment in our home planet.\n\nThere aren't many alien civilizations willing to respect our traditions, and yours is one of them. While our foreign policy will remain unchanged, as a token of gratitude, we prepared some energy credits and a special product from our fairy forest for you. Please accept this humble gift as a testament to peace between our nations."

  gts_evt_elf.18.a: "Thank you very much."
  gts_evt_elf.19.name: "Elven Empire Faces Unrest"
  gts_evt_elf.19.desc: "Our intelligence department specializing in Treant Elf diplomacy has sent us troubling news. Perhaps due to corporate conspiracies, natural disasters, or perhaps their queen's exhaustion, the Treant Elf Kingdom appears to be in a severe economic crisis. Following this is an exacerbated political crisis, with the queen too ill to govern. Yet, the Treant Elf diplomats refuse any aid.\n\nOur analysis suggests civil war may erupt within weeks.\n\nUpon receiving this news, Tiffany personally negotiated with their diplomats for our aid, then this knowledgeable and experienced young girl drafted a letter to us, detailing her ideals, experiences, work suggestions, and... her inheritance arrangements in case of her death.\n\nBy the time we received her letter, she had already embarked on her ship to her homeland."
  gts_evt_elf.19.a: "A storm is coming..."
  gts_evt_elf.20.name: "Tiffany Quells the Unrest"
  gts_evt_elf.20.desc: "The turmoil in the Treant Elf Kingdom has ended. Tiffany reconciled with her mother and acted as regent to resolve the chaos.\n\nAfter a year of reforms, the economic and political crises were resolved, and her mother Sharul recovered.\nTiffany had planned to return to our nation, but the queen stopped her and initiated a communication request with us."
  gts_evt_elf.20.a: "Connect Communications"
  gts_evt_elf.21.name: "Sharul"
  gts_evt_elf.21.desc: "Hello, I am Sharul, queen of the Treant Elves. This incident made me reflect deeply; my meticulous plans have failed at times, and Tiffany's education in your empire truly saved the Treant Elves. I've decided to gradually open up and facilitate exchange between our peoples. This role will be given to Tiffany.\n\n§EWhat??? Is this really appropriate...§!\n\nYes, your performance in this event proves you're a capable leader. You'll oversee diplomacy, economy, and reforms, and I'll unconditionally support your decisions.\n\n§EBut-what should I do...§! (Tiffany looks at you with a plea for help.)"
  gts_evt_elf.21.a: "We will protect your independence"
  gts_evt_elf.21.b: "You are welcome to join our empire at any time"
  gts_evt_elf.21.c: "Our friendship will become that of our peoples"
  gts_evt_elf.22.name: "Elven Empire Faces Coup"
  gts_evt_elf.22.desc: "Our intelligence department on Treant Elf diplomacy has delivered shocking news. A coup has erupted in the Treant Kingdom. Rebels attacked and set the royal forest ablaze using illegal weapons. Key officials have been killed, including Queen Sharul Westwood. Loyalist armies and border navies are converging on the capital, and the elves are on the brink of a devastating civil war.\n\nUpon receiving this news, Tiffany immediately requested open borders to allow elf refugees in. After a respectful bow, the sorrowful yet determined girl piloted her ship towards her motherland."
  gts_evt_elf.22.a: "Clear the path for refugees at once!"
  gts_evt_elf.23.name: "Tiffany Ascends to Power"
  gts_evt_elf.23.desc: "The power struggle in the Treant Elf Kingdom has concluded. As the rightful heir, Tiffany, with the support of the Treant populace, suppressed all opposition and ascended to her mother's throne.\n\nTiffany's work experience in our nation also ensured her smooth realization of her ideals-ending isolationist policies and gradually opening up to the outside.\n\nOnce everything is in place, our first diplomatic dialogue with our former colleague began."
  gts_evt_elf.23.a: "Connect Communications"
  gts_evt_elf.24.name: "Tiffany"
  gts_evt_elf.24.desc: "Um, hello there, uh, wearing a formal dress for holographic communication doesn't quite feel as comfortable as face-to-face chats, haha. As you can see, I now bear my mother's responsibilities and must protect the Treant Elves. While I cherish our past working days, we must distinguish diplomacy from personal relationships.\n\nDon't feel sad-it just makes me a bit lost, too. I'm here to discuss diplomatic collaboration, fully aware of the power disparity between us and other galactic civilizations. I hope to discuss accepting your protection. We have three options: forming an alliance, seeking protection, or becoming an autonomous territory of your empire. Rest assured, this negotiation has passed a public vote. As long as we sincerely cooperate, there's no reason for the elves to oppose."
  gts_evt_elf.25.name: "Elven Empire's Empress Passes Away"
  gts_evt_elf.25.desc: "Our intelligence department on Treant Elf diplomacy has delivered bad news. Sharul Westwood, queen of the Treant Elves, encountered an accident aboard her nation's newly developed Westwind airship. The airship's gas chamber exploded and ultimately crashed. The Elder Council has declared a state of emergency. Considering the former queen had no heirs besides the 'rebel' Tiffany, ambitious forces might exploit the power vacuum.\n\nWhen Tiffany learned of this, she immediately left our empire aboard her airship, leaving only a brief communication apologizing for her departure. She stated she must return to stabilize the situation and prevent bloodshed."
  gts_evt_elf.25.a: "Wish her luck!"
