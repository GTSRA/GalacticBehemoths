  site_gts_barren_foot: "Barren World"
  site_gts_barren_foot_name: "Stone"
  site_gts_barren_foot_desc: "This world is desolate, with only deep craters and giant rocks scattered about."
  great_footprint: "Footprint Hemisphere"
  great_footprint_desc: "The planet's first visitors significantly impacted its geography; inhabitants benefiting greatly from the planet's inadvertent creator."
  gts_anomaly_foot_category: "Anomalous Craters"
  gts_anomaly_foot_category_desc: "This planet bears many unnatural crater marks."
  gts_evt_footprint.1.name: "Anomalous Craters"
  gts_evt_footprint.1.desc: "Investigations reveal numerous craters of varying sizes formed by impacts and towering giant rocks. We can establish an observation point for further investigation."
  gts_evt_footprint.2.name: "Landing"
  gts_evt_footprint.2.desc: "Our survey team has successfully landed and established a research camp. As revealed by aerial scanning, this planet is quite barren, with the only notable features being ubiquitous deep craters and towering stone peaks. During preliminary investigations, the team discovered plant fossils, suggesting that this planet is or once was potentially colonizable. Overall, the difficulty is low, and our scientists are confident they can complete the survey in a relatively short time."
  BARRENFOOT1: "Alright"
  gts_evt_footprint.3.name: "Investigation"
  gts_evt_footprint.3.desc: "After scanning and surveying the planet, the research team reached a rather disappointing conclusion: This planet was once a vibrant, habitable world but lost its life due to countless meteor impacts, evidenced by craters and meteor remnants. Such stories are not uncommon in the cosmic sea. However, its abundant stone formations could potentially serve as excellent quarries. The survey team plans to conduct a week's worth of geological investigation before withdrawing from the planet, concluding the exploration."
  BARRENFOOT2: "Engineering +3, farewell"
  gts_evt_footprint.4.name: "Meteor"
  gts_evt_footprint.4.desc: "The survey team reported peculiar astronomical observations: a meteor appeared with a blue glow in the night sky, fleeting across and crashing into the ground. However, our orbiting research ship detected no meteors entering the planet's atmosphere from space... as if it appeared out of nowhere. The survey team has suspended their planned research, setting camp on a mountaintop to conduct detailed astronomical observations."
  BARRENFOOT3: "Meteors aren't a good omen"
  gts_evt_footprint.5.name: "Great Sound"
  gts_evt_footprint.5.desc: "The surveillance satellite urgently reported a massive earthquake emanating from archaeological sites. Its epicenter came from the surface, exceeding our maximum earthquake magnitude threshold. Given this planet’s stable geological structure, such a significant earthquake was unexpected. Images transmitted from the planetary base show only dust storms shrouding the planet, and the team lost all contact. We can only pray they survive this calamity."
  BARRENFOOT4: "What on earth happened?"
  gts_evt_footprint.6.name: "Conclusion"
  gts_evt_footprint.6.desc: "As the dust settled, we saw a massive footprint spanning half the planet, with the big toe on the North Pole and the heel nearly touching the South Pole. The research team soon restored communication, having been underground in a cavern miles deep assembling a geological investigation station, unaware of the surface's seismic upheaval. The expedition's sole injured member, a clumsy investigator girl, had twisted an ankle chasing her group in the dark, stepping onto this planet and misstepping on a rock. Upon resurfacing, they were astonished by the surface's transformation. The team resumed researching the footprint and locating their scattered camp and vessel. After reconstructing camp communications, analyses of the residue within the giant crater unveiled shocking truths: This oversized footprint originated from that clumsy inspector girl. Comparing eyewitness recollections and integrating survey data, we deciphered the planet’s mystery: A highly unstable dimensional portal exists here, just large enough for someone of our species to slip a foot through. Its exit is much larger, magnifying items many times when passing through. Sand and rock usually fall in, thus appearing as oversized boulders unnoticed by the team until amplified and spotlighted this instance. The portal's artificial or natural origin remains speculative. Serendipitously, disaster inadvertently bequeathed prosperity: The upheaval converted this barren world into a habitable one, albeit chilly, with immense potential. Tourism possibilities abound, attracting visitors and investments en masse, while mining benefits from resultant pits. Additionally, we could explore our kind’s gigantic footprint and the mercurial portal meticulously. Upon the young lady's agreement, she was acclaimed honorary governor of the planet, with the entire research team rewarded more funding for this unintentional breakthrough."
  BARRENFOOT5: "I must visit this place someday!"
