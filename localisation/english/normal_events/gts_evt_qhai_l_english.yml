  gts_event_qhai.0.title: "Strange VHF Signal"
  gts_event_qhai.0.desc.a: "After a period of research, the science team has confirmed the VHF signal that was unintentionally detected by our science ship. Further observation and monitoring reveal that this signal is emitted simultaneously and regularly from over two hundred hidden transmission points on the planet. It has been specially modulated so that small and technologically advanced receivers can clearly receive it, while other receivers can only perceive a slight disturbance. The research report also recommends further study, suggesting that only landing on the planet for deeper scientific exploration can ascertain the specifics of this signal."
  gts_event_qhai.0.desc.b: "After a period of research, the science team has had to declare that the VHF signal perturbation, unintentionally detected by our science ship, has no special meaning, or at least cannot be successfully received by us. Further observation and monitoring reveal that this perturbation does indeed originate from a point on the planet, but appears to be specially designed in such a way that all our receivers are unable to obtain further information."

  gts_event_qhai.20.title: "Celestial Uniform Shoe"
  gts_event_qhai.20.desc: "The science ship [root.GetName] entered a new star system according to the exploration plan, but this time, to the surprise of all the researchers and our science officer, most of the planets orbiting the star had disappeared, and their positions were occupied by an incomparably massive black uniform shoe. From the appearance alone, it is no different from the ordinary maid shoes or JK shoes in our empire, except for its enormous size that is almost the size of an entire planet. Obviously, it originally belonged to an unknown celestial giantess but was left here for some reason, becoming such a massive structure in front of the science ship [root.GetName].\n\nFaced with such a giant shoe that could fit our entire capital inside, the research personnel, not daring to act rashly, have made an urgent communication to us and requested the initiation of a special project to investigate both the exterior and interior of this shoe. However, we should act quickly, as the mysterious and free celestial giantess may never return, or may return at any moment to this, her 'shoe cabinet,' and casually crush us as invading bacteria."

  gts_event_qhai.21.title: "\"Wearing the Shoe\""
  gts_event_qhai.21.desc: "\"So, you want me to... send this shoe back?\" \n\n[root.leader.GetName], who has drifted from the edge of the empire (and incidentally smashed a large number of tiny planets on the way), entered the gravity well of this star system, now holding the tip of the uniform shoe, which in our eyes has already acquired a touch of divinity, and carefully examining its exterior. At the same time, several small ships launched by the research team on [root.leader.GetName]'s body have landed on the shoe's upper and insole to conduct further exploration. Due to the peculiarity of celestial giantess science officers, we obviously cannot customize a research ship that fits her body size, so we have to adopt the current method: use the leader herself as a platform to carry a large number of research equipment and technical personnel. It could be said that [root.leader.GetName] is now a walking scientific hub.\n\n\"Hmm... if you need a shoe to colonize, isn't this one I'm wearing ok?\" \n\n\"What what? It's already... full? Oh well...\" \n\nWith a slight sigh, [root.leader.GetName] held the shoe, hesitated briefly, and then, as if thinking of something interesting, curled a smile and, swinging the uniform shoe in her hand (which was exactly the right size for her celestial feet), continued to communicate with us:\n\n\"Come to think of it, it's been a while since I changed shoes... why don't I try how it feels first~?\"\n\n\"Besides, I only need to wear it for a little while, and the residual warmth and foot perspiration resources should be enough for your early colonies, right~?\"\n\nBefore we could respond, [root.leader.GetName] playfully wiggled her feet, shaking off her shoes where countless lives were parasitizing, revealing her slender and soft white silk feet. A warm aura and the dampness of foot perspiration instantly enveloped the entire star system. Then, with her face slightly flushed, [root.leader.GetName] gently licked her lips and raised her white-silk-clad feet, slowly slipping them into the uniform shoe. The research team, already deep inside the shoe cavity, had to urgently activate their FTL engines and land on [root.leader.GetName]'s white-silk foot, which was gradually sinking into the shoe, seeking a gap between the toe-hollow or an already-established toe-print colony to escape the fate of being crushed on the insole by [root.leader.GetName]'s \"petite\" foot.\n\nThen, about ten system hours later, [root.leader.GetName], carrying her own shoes in her left hand, floated back to our capital system. After removing the uniform shoe, which was now filled with the aroma of the maiden's feet and heatwaves, next to our capital, she playfully lifted her soft silk feet and wiggled them in the sky above [capital_planet.GetName], full of our citizens, before putting on her shoes again and floating towards the edge of the empire."

  gts_event_qhai.23.title: "Exterior Shoe Exploration, Complete"
  gts_event_qhai.23.desc: "Our science ship has basically explored the outer surface of the shoe and sent the important data back to the empire's database. Science Officer [root.leader.GetName]'s observations show that there is some wear and tear on the shoe's tip and upper, and the shiny leather also has some dirt, mainly from small asteroids attracted by the immense gravity. These marks and spots, which might be completely invisible to the giantess, are as vast as chasms in our eyes. It seems that this shoe has been abandoned here for a long time. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the science ship discovered multiple planetary debris on the sole of the uniform shoe, some of which even contain obvious ruins of civilization among the dirt and dust. Whether these planets were unconsciously crushed under the giantess's feet during her movements, or whether she unleashed divine punishment upon them with her sacred soles after angering her, we have no way of knowing."

  gts_event_qhai.23.option: "Very well, continue."
  gts_event_qhai.24.title: "The World Beneath the Heel"
  gts_event_qhai.24.desc: "When our science ship, carrying Science Officer [root.leader.GetName], slowly entered the mouth of the shoe and entered the cavity, an intense sense of oppression almost instantly sank into the hearts of the research team. Unlike the visual effect brought on by the smooth exterior of the uniform shoe, the interior of the shoe is completely surrounded by the dark and profound space within the shoe, and everything in front and on the sides is a dark brown, furry wall. This was obviously designed to make the giantess feel better, but in the eyes of [root.leader.GetName], it looks like a huge furry forest. A faint smell of foot aroma permeated the enormous space. Even though the celestial giantess has been gone for who-knows-how-long, the traces she left behind still affect everything here like a miracle.\n\nThe science ship timidly landed on the insole of the uniform shoe. The endless insole plain is inlaid with a few tiny asteroids and a few grains of foot dirt that are even larger than normal meteorites. Although the foot sweat that once filled the insole has evaporated over a long period of time, the residual smell still lingers.\n\nAfter simply collecting samples of the maiden's foot dirt and mapping the insole, the science ship successfully left the celestial uniform shoe. However, to utilize this area safely, we will still need several more detailed explorations."

  gts_event_qhai.24.option: "We will not stop."
  gts_event_qhai.25.title: "The World Beneath the Arch"
  gts_event_qhai.25.desc: "The science ship [root.GetName] entered the depths of the shoe cavity of the uniform shoe for the second time. With the experience of the previous time, this time the research and exploration team were not too flustered. Several exploration team members even stated that there was a strange sense of peace within the shoe, including the surrounding foot scent and the foot dirt continent under the science ship. \n\nWith this in mind, the science ship landed in the center of the insole of the uniform shoe and began the planned exploration. Traversing the soft, furry forest was indeed not an easy task. If one was not careful, one could get lost in the maze created by the foot dirt and insole, and from then on, completely become an insignificant foot bug in the depths of this celestial uniform shoe. Fortunately, under the leadership of Science Officer [root.leader.GetName], our research team successfully overcame various difficulties, collected a large number of valuable samples, and boarded the science ship to leave the interior of the uniform shoe through the shoe opening."

  gts_event_qhai.25.option: "Keep pushing forward, it's almost over."
  gts_event_qhai.26.title: "The World Beneath the Toes"
  gts_event_qhai.26.desc: "Unexpectedly! Just as our exploration and research team were enduring the intense foot odor and stuffy environment to explore further, we discovered a primitive civilization in the depths of the insole of this uniform shoe! \n\nAccording to the communication sent back by [root.leader.GetName], we can learn: this civilization was an early civilization that only formed a few hundred years ago, evolved from some bacteria left over from the celestial giantess’s toes, and has an initial primitive social structure. Since the origin of this civilization came from the maiden's foot, their food can only rely on the traces of foot dirt remaining on the barren insole, and the atmosphere they depend on is also full of the fragrance of the giantess's feet. If we had arrived any later, this civilization would have even faced extinction due to the loss of the source of the giantess foot dirt.\n\nMoreover, although the individuals in this civilization may only be the size of microorganisms in the eyes of the celestial giantess, they have approached one-thousandth of our size in our eyes, and our arrival has also brought a deep sense of fear and shock to this civilization. Some individuals have even climbed onto the tip of our Science Officer [root.leader.GetName]'s shoes to express their reverence. Therefore, having completely explored the entire uniform shoe, we can finally begin colonization here and consider how to treat this small civilization that evolved from the giantess foot bacteria."

Even its cute appearance cannot hide the oppressive feeling of it being such a large object belonging to a giantess - it is like directly facing the planetary-sized feet of that celestial giantess herself. \n\nTherefore, to prevent unnecessary losses and troubles to the greatest extent possible, we have decided to embrace the power of the giantess: to send a leader who is willing to follow us and who is also a celestial giantess to recycle this shoe, and decide whether or not to colonize it after bringing it back to the home system."

Besides gathering data and mapping everything in detail, we might even be able to use the changes in forms and the topography of the insole plains to observe the pressure points on the giantess's sole when she was delivering stepping executions, perhaps this information can be used to deal with other unpredictable celestial giantesses in the galaxy.\n\nHowever, going so deeply into an unknown shoe without the help of another celestial giantess is obviously quite dangerous, so we have to recruit explorers from among those with extensive experience and a deep fascination with giantess feet to follow the science officer to conduct explorations of the interior of the shoe. Despite all this, the number of applicants for this task is still countless."
  GTS_UNIFORM_SHOES_TINY4_SPECIAL_PROJECT: "Interior Shoe Exploration - Toe Region"

  GTS_UNIFORM_SHOES_TINY4_SPECIAL_PROJECT_DESC: "We have been exploring the interior of the uniform shoe for a long time, collecting many valuable specimens and gaining valuable experience in surviving inside a giantess's shoe. And now, what is blocking us is the area with the most harsh environment in the girl's shoe: the area under the tips of her toes. Obviously, the tips of her toes are farther away from the shoe opening. The star light from outside, which can barely provide some illumination, has almost been completely blocked by the shoe walls on all sides, not to mention the increasingly dense odors and the fog of foot sweat steam, making the tip of the insole that has been crushed by the maiden's toes countless times even more dangerous."

  gts_event_qhai.1.title: "The Mystery of the Signal Transmitters"
  gts_event_qhai.1.desc.a: "This phase of the excavation has uncovered more than 330 transmitters that continuously transmit signals. It appears that there is a device on these transmitters that monitors the size of living beings, which automatically deactivated the self-defense systems – seemingly only effective against larger beings – that we later discovered upon dismantling them, after identifying our archaeological team. It is worth mentioning that the shape, weapon type, and engraved language are significantly different on the various transmitters, and studies have shown that they were all modified in a somewhat hasty manner at a specific time long after their manufacture.\nIn the vicinity of the transmitters, our archaeologists' signal receivers detected another very subtle signal, which was found on different transmitters. This signal was very easy to decipher, and was finally identified as the coordinates of a location on the planet. The research team has already started to formulate an archaeological research plan based on these coordinates."
  gts_event_qhai.1.desc.b: "This phase of the excavation has uncovered more than 330 transmitters that continuously transmit signals. It appears that the device on these transmitters that monitors the size of living beings used its self-defense system to attack our archaeological team after identifying them. Fortunately these self-defense systems seemed to be severely outdated. Apart from some members experiencing headaches due to psychic weaponry, there were no other adverse effects. After disarming the transmitters and sending them to the science ship for research, we discovered that the different transmitters had significantly different shapes, weapon types, and engraved languages. Studies have also shown that the transmitters were all modified in a somewhat hasty manner at a specific time long after their manufacture.\nInitially, other than this information, we made little progress, except for discovering some disturbances that could not be clearly monitored even by our smallest receivers. However, after an analysis of the excavation site, we discovered that although the transmitters were not laid out completely regularly, they seemed to intentionally avoid a certain area. Currently, the research team is preparing to begin further research from the center of that area."

  gts_event_qhai.2.title: "A Complex of Unclear Purpose"
  gts_event_qhai.2.desc.a: "Further examination of the coordinates was very successful. After some excavation, we began to discover artifacts from tens of thousands of years ago at a depth of about 20 meters below the surface. As larger-scale excavation work progressed, a magnificent and well-preserved complex of buildings, whose purpose is somewhat difficult to determine, gradually revealed itself to the research personnel.\nIn preliminary research, almost all scientists agreed that this was a fortress, likely built during a war between creatures of similar size to us and creatures much larger than them. The evidence for this is everywhere: energy field shields specifically for resisting enormous pressure, kinetic cannons with calibers too large to have any practical combat value against creatures of similar size, and magic circles that could only be successfully activated by dozens or hundreds of skilled psionic users standing in designated locations. All of this shows that this was a well-armed fortress built specifically to fight against extremely large creatures. However, a building ruin that was almost completely crushed on the perimeter shows that this fortress did not achieve its defensive goals. After all the defenses were broken, the defenders were very likely forced to surrender for some reason due to the power of the attackers. Furthermore, echoing the differences in the shapes of the transmitters from before, weaponry representing different technologies were found in this complex. The different language inscriptions found on the transmitters were also found in different locations in the complex.\nHowever, an in-depth study of the complex has shaken the conclusions drawn during earlier excavation. Behind the rearmed gate, we found hidden passages for creatures of different sizes; and in the restoration of the internal structure of the main building, researchers also discovered that its internal facilities and external armed systems were built during different periods, with the specific dates corresponding with the years when the transmitters were first built and modified. At the same time, the internal facilities also seem extremely unsuitable for defense: compared to their tactical purpose, many gigantic rooms gave the researchers the first impression that they appeared more like meeting halls and lounges. It also seemed like the facilities in these rooms had been used by creatures of different sizes together, but they had been intentionally dismantled during later modifications."
  gts_event_qhai.2.desc.b: "The further examination of that blank area was very successful. After some excavation, our researchers had barely stuck a probe into the ground in the center of the area when they started to continuously discover artifacts from tens of thousands of years ago. As the team's excavation work progressed, a magnificent and unusually well-preserved building complex, whose purpose was somewhat difficult to ascertain, gradually revealed itself to the researchers. In preliminary investigations, almost all scientists agreed that this was a fortress once used by small beings, likely built during a war between creatures much smaller than us and creatures of similar size to us. The evidence for this is everywhere: energy field shields which, though exquisitely made, seem to be able to resist our researchers stomping on them after being forcefully charged, kinetic cannons manufactured by small beings with calibers similar to that of our small-caliber cannons, and magic circles which seem to require many small psionic power stations at designated locations to successfully activate. All of this suggests that this is a well-armed fortress built specifically to fight against creatures of similar size to us.\nHowever, a building ruin that was almost completely crushed on the perimeter shows that this fortress did not achieve its defensive goals. After the defenses were breached, the defenders likely did not continue to struggle after the attackers managed to crush the perimeter buildings after a very few steps, for some reason. Furthermore, echoing the differences in the shapes of the transmitters from before, weaponry representing different technologies were found in this complex. The different language inscriptions that were found on the transmitters were also found in different locations in the complex.\nHowever, an in-depth study of the complex has shaken the conclusions of earlier excavations. After breaking open the alloy armor on the outside of the doors, we discovered that the main building had a passage just large enough for our researchers to enter – however, after a few steps, the passage was intentionally cut off, and so we finally had to send in small robots to continue the following exploration. In the structural reconstruction research of the main building, the researchers also discovered that its internal facilities and external armed systems were built at different times, with the specific dates corresponding with the years when the transmitters were first built and modified. At the same time, the internal facilities also seem extremely unsuitable for defense: compared to their tactical function, many large rooms of the main building gave the researchers the first impression that they were more like meeting halls and lounges. It also seemed that facilities to be jointly used by creatures of different sizes had been installed in these rooms, but they had been intentionally dismantled during later modifications."

The sizes of the script varies, in line with the size of the creatures that were estimated to have used the complex in earlier studies. Most of these languages have baffled our linguists. Only a few of two or three languages somewhat match the language habits we have seen. After focusing on deciphering these languages, we were able to break down many of the sentences.\nSoon after entering the door, we discovered ten standing giant slabs, each with exactly 340 lines written in different languages. We quickly discovered that each slab was simply the 340 language translations of a single sentence, translated from the largest size of script that is only seen on these slabs in the entire complex:\n\nMeeting Minutes\nGreat Galactic Union, 2837th Meeting\nTime: DR81209 Y2O120\nProcess: Giantess Empire proposed a motion, number 7022\nVoting: 1 in favor, 0 abstained, 339 against\nGiantess Empire representative speaking (omitted content)\nAccording to Amendment 42-X of the constitution (the Diplomatic Weight Amendment), the motion was passed and included in the constitution\nAmendment: All resources and life forms in this galaxy are to be regarded as private property\nBelonging to the Goddess of the Giantess Empire and her subjects\n\nBased on the assumptions of our researchers, this place may have been a deliberation site for an organization similar to a Great Galactic Union. After the above meeting ended, the Great Galactic Union obviously had no further function and the war between the Giantess Empire and the remaining resistance forces of other countries broke out. The resistance personnel converted the site into a fortress, but ultimately, for some unknown reason, they did not fight to the end and chose to surrender.\n\nJust when the survey activity was about to come to an end, our researchers received a signal for the third time next to the stone slabs, a signal even weaker than the previous two. The research team, who was about to have a celebration feast, returned to work and began to prepare for the next exploration..."

The size of the script varied slightly, in line with the size of the creatures that were estimated to have used the complex in previous studies. The majority of those languages nearly baffled our linguists; however, one of the languages somewhat matched language habits that we've seen before. After focusing on deciphering this language, we were able to break down many sentences within it.\nShortly after entering the door, we discovered ten small stone tablets standing upright. Each tablet contained exactly 340 lines, written in different languages. We quickly realized that each tablet contained only a sentence in 340 different translations - from the largest-size script in the entire complex, appearing only on these tablets, and also the only language we have been able to decipher:\n\nMeeting Minutes\nGreat Galactic Union, 2837th Meeting\nTime: DR81209 Y2O120\nProcess: The Giantess Empire proposed motion number 7022\nVoting: 1 in favor, 0 abstaining, 339 opposed\nGiantess Empire representative speaking (contents omitted)\nAccording to the Constitution's 42-X Amendment (Diplomatic Weight Amendment), the motion has been approved and incorporated into the Constitution\nAmended content: All lifeforms and resources in this galaxy, considered as private property\nBelong to the Goddess of the Giantess Empire and her subjects\n\nBased on the assumptions of our research team, this may have been a site for deliberation, similar to the Great Galactic Union organization. After said meeting had concluded, the Great Galactic Union no longer seemed to serve any purpose, and war broke out between the Giantess Empire and the remaining scattered resistance forces of other nations. The resistance forces converted the site into a fortress, although due to unknown reasons, they didn't fight until the end, and instead chose to surrender.\n\nJust as the surveying was about to conclude, our research team detected a signal near the stone tablet for the third time, a signal which was even weaker than the previous two, which we would likely have missed had we not been making preparations in advance.

According to the instructions in the signal, we moved the stone slabs to a designated location and opened a secret passage to the underground.\nAfter walking along the secret path for a long time, during which we passed through a few mechanisms that confirmed the size and genes of the visitors (it seemed these machines only recognized the body size and emotional state of the visitors, and only those with the correct body size and were not in a forced emotional state could pass through smoothly), we arrived at a room surrounded on all sides by storage devices and supercomputers. As we entered, the holographic displays in the room lit up and, in the language we had translated, informed us as follows:\n\nGiantesses cannot be trusted, giantesses cannot be tolerated, and giantesses do not deserve friendship.\nIf you have arrived here without using violence, then we congratulate you and accept you as the 340th representative from a member state of the Great Galactic Union. However, we will also be sounding our own death knell, because it means that all our resistance has ultimately failed. \nHowever, we are going to let you see the achievements and glories we once had. The three outstanding individuals that we have collectively selected, from the Haravataka Empire, the Naizerell Sacred Authority, and the Biliktipi Federation, will teach you the most extraordinary of all of our knowledge.

As such, we had to resort to destructive excavation. This involved moving the entire complex, piece by piece into our transporters, sending the pieces back to a designated museum to be properly preserved. We then conducted another excavation of area below the complex's foundation. This excavation allowed us to find a small passage into the subsurface area, ending at a room which was only meant to be entered by small people. However, our reckless demolition of the ceiling caused us to unfortunately activate the self-destruct systems of a number of computers in the room...\nWhile we attempted to secure some storage disks using our robotic arms before immediately retreating, the explosion caused by the self-destruct program still resulted in one researcher sustaining severe injuries, while other research team members suffered burns and other varying injuries.

  gts_event_qhai.8.title: "War Betting Activity on [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
  gts_event_qhai.8.desc: "The recent popularity on our country's social media has drawn our attention to a betting activity that is centered on the [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName] observation station. It is believed that this activity was initiated by a few researchers working at the observation station, and then gradually the participants expanded to include other staff at the observation station and those with information living in nearby star systems. In the end, it gradually expanded to become a large-scale betting project that everyone in the entire sector has had a hand in.\nThe main topic of the betting is armed conflict of the native races on the planet or, to put it more bluntly, wars between the native countries. Thanks to our permission for in-depth observation of the planet, scientists are able to research intelligence about the diplomatic relations, technological level, and military deployments between the countries. These pieces of intelligence were used by a few researchers with a good 'business sense' to set odds and open bets. Participants can bet on the countries and generals they support in the hopes that they will win the war or a specific battle. Nowadays, this betting activity has already become fairly large-scale. Many cultural works based on the native races on this star system - such as novels, popular science, or strategic games - have also been released and have created good commercial value.\nStrictly speaking, this activity is clearly not recognized by the relevant regulations of the observation station, and should also be prohibited for ethical reasons. But since the betting activity has created economic benefits, we can also support this activity while also demanding that its profits are nationalized - after all, the public's interest in the natives of [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName] is also beneficial to the region's related scientific and educational development."

  gts_event_qhai.9.title: "Destruction Incident on [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
  gts_event_qhai.9.desc.a: "The Criminal Investigation Department reported to us yesterday a vicious criminal case that occurred on [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName]. According to the observation station personnel, one of our ordinary citizens illegally smuggled themselves to [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName], and then carried out extensive destruction there. When the observation station guards sent a ship down to the planet to arrest them, the suspect had already almost completely destroyed a few cities, military garrisons, and some areas nearby, causing incalculable losses to the planet's scientific research work.\nFurther interrogation of the suspect allowed us to basically reconstruct the whole picture of the incident. The suspect was a participant in betting activities centered on the native wars on  [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName]. In the past few months, an outstanding military figure emerged from one of the native kingdoms -the Chivarahuka Kingdom-she has led her troops to victories against superior numbers multiple times, reversing the previous downturn in an unequal war and turning it into an advantage that was sufficient for launching a counter-offensive. The suspect began betting on this figure as soon as she began commanding the troops, and the total amount of money bet increased as her victories continued, until it exceeded the amount that their personal savings could accommodate. The suspect, blinded by the desire to win money, even took out a loan specifically for betting on this military figure.\nHowever, victory and defeat are commonplace in military affairs. The difference in power meant that the counter-offensive launched by this general could not be sustained. In the end, she suffered heavy casualties in a battle deep in enemy territory, and only barely escaped with her life. This great defeat meant that the suspect went instantly from being an overnight sensation with quick riches to being a heavily indebted delinquent. The despair of having their dreams shattered ultimately led to the suspect's crime. According to the suspect's own statement, they landed their ship near the capital of the Chivarahuka Kingdom. (It is said that the suspect did not know the map, and their knowledge of the planet's geography mainly came from corresponding movies and games.) They first demanded that the ruler of the kingdom give the general who had been defeated to them. After she was handed over, they engaged in large amounts of destruction in the capital city under the guise of “punishment.” The general who was handed over was imprisoned in the suspect's small hole. When we rescued her, she had already lost her human form, and it was speculated that this was the result of being harshly used  during masturbation. After this destruction, they went to the location where the decisive battle previously took place (during which a lot of destruction occurred) where they had a bloodthirsty rampage and massacred the enemy troops who were reorganizing at the time. The suspect claimed that they originally intended to go to the enemy's capital to 'play around,' but were arrested by the observation station guards who were quickly dispatched before they could succeed. (Despite attempts to minimize the damage, the suspect's refusal to arrest led to the majority of the surrounding area being razed to the ground.) According to forensic analysis of the architectural fragments and human tissue extracted from between the suspect's teeth, underarms, breasts, palms, lower body, toes, and the shoes, socks, and underwear they were wearing when they were arrested, the suspect's statement is generally true.\nThe further reports from the observation station reflect the natives’ reaction to this incident. Nations and groups of different beliefs have provided different explanations for this incident. Among them, the mainstream view is that a war goddess widely worshiped by the locals punished a chosen one who lost the battle, but also helped her fulfill her wish to defeat the Empire’s troops.\nSome members of the public (believed to mostly be individuals fans of the military figure or the enemy commander, they temporarily put aside their disputes and stood together) have posted on social media, calling on the government to severely punish this criminal. Our research units have also placed a high importance on this case due to its severe adverse impact on the observation of the native planet."

The suspect was a participant in betting activities centered on the native wars on [event_target:qhai_pre_ftl_planet.GetName]. In the past few months, an outstanding military figure emerged from one of the native republics – the Chivarahuka Confederation.  She led her troops to victory multiple times against inferior numbers. After taking office as commander-in-chief, she was able to turn around the previous decline of an unequal war in a way that would allow them to begin counter-offensives.

However,\nHowever, victory and defeat are common aspects of military affairs. The sheer difference in numbers meant that the counter-offensives carried out by the general were unsustainable, and her side suffered heavy casualties in a series of battles deep in enemy turf. That battle resulted in her plans to all but collapse. This resulted in the suspect quickly going from being rich without work, to being indebted and untrustworthy. Having their dreams suddenly shattered resulted in the suspect to have malicious intent. According to the suspect's confession, they landed their ship at the capital near the capital of the Chivarahuka Kingdom. (It is rumored that the suspect does not know any maps, and their understanding of the planet's geography comes from a combination of movies and games.) They first demanded that the confederation's leader hand over the defeated officer, so that they could unleash a campaign of destruction as 'punishment' for their defeat. The general who was handed over was then held captive in the suspect’s small opening (it is speculated that her body had been abused during masturbation).  When we rescued her, she had long lost her human shape. After the destructive rampage, the suspect went to the front line. (During the transit, she once again damaged everything within sight) In an act of spite, the suspect indiscriminately massacred the troops from the two respective factions, which were clashing on the front. The suspect confessed that she had intended to continue the destruction further, going so far as to “play” with the enemy’s capital city as well. Before this could be accomplished, the station guards dispatched a response, arresting her after some resistance, leaving much of the surrounding area razed. Forensics specialists were able to confirm the suspect’s statement based on a microscopic analysis of the architectural fragments, metal fragments, and human tissue that they extracted between the suspect’s teeth, armpits, breasts, palms, lower body, toes, and the shoes, socks, and underwear that she was wearing when she was captured. The further reports from the observatory show that the natives interpreted this event as a confirmation that extraterrestrials do, in fact, exist, which had significantly advanced the natives’ understanding of the player factions’ existence.\nSome private citizens have used social media to rally around the victim, and are demanding harsh punishment for the suspect. These private citizens, mostly, all seem to be fans of the military leader, or the enemy’s lead commander. Putting their differences behind them. Our research division also believes that the suspect’s behavior will cause a serious detriment to the planets research going forward."

  gts_event_qhai.31.title: "Friendly Surrender Ceremony"
  gts_event_qhai.31.desc: "Today the sun is shining brightly. On the suburban plains of the planet's capital, the local giantess leader reluctantly surrendered. Our giantess general, as a representative of friendship, invited the other side for afternoon tea on the verdant plains like a normal day at an elegant girls' school, with light, elegant music as accompaniment. The enemy giantess gradually lowered her guard and began to talk peacefully with our representative.\n\nTens of thousands of enemy small people are watching this harmonious scene. Seeing that the giantesses, who are more than a thousand times their size, have laid down their hostility, they cannot help but breathe a sigh of relief. This means their cities will not be trampled by the giantesses...right?\n\nThey were right… at least partially.\n\nAs the two giantesses gradually turned from enemies into friends, the physical distance between them also decreased. Our general mischievously reached inside the collar of the enemy giantess's blouse; buttons that weighed several tons were instantly popped off and flew in an arc, crashing into the local capital and slicing a building in half. However, the local giantess leader was too distracted by the small losses; she excitedly tore open our representative's top, and the two of them intimately provoked each other with their proud white peaks and pink nipples. Then they pulled down their panties that were already soaked in love fluids from their skirts and playfully threw them over the heads of the small people watching on.\n\nAfter that, they began to entwine each other in embraces and caresses on the suburban plains. The originally neat uniforms were quickly torn to pieces, covered in mud and bodily fluids. And the love fluids produced by the mutual rubbing of their small holes have already overflowed onto the plains, even washing away bridge and dams on the rivers, causing love fluid floods to flow into the city several kilometers away, so those small people who did not dare to come and watch could also smell the rich scent. The coupling of their breasts caused the milk to spray out like a fountain onto the verdant fields and farmland. Then these beautiful farmlands were soon transformed by the giantesses' soles, silk feet, beautiful legs, and even their small holes and rears, into piles of sticky hills or puddles of lewd ponds. Some unlucky farmers and individual viewers who were unable to escape became decorations or seasoning for the giantesses' intimate acts. The capital in the distance was shaken by rhythmic earthquakes until nightfall, and only after the local leader reluctantly said goodbye to our gentle conqueror did the people of this planet have the chance to sleep."

  gts_event_qhai.32.title: "Humiliating Surrender Ceremony"
  gts_event_qhai.32.desc: "The surrender ceremony itself was very short. Outside of the planet's capital, the enemy giantess leader reluctantly announced that they were giving up their resistance. However, our general did not intend to end things there. She took the opportunity to push the enemy giantess towards the city that she had just protected. Even though the local giantess, who is a thousand times bigger than an ordinary small person, quickly propped herself up with her hands, several city blocks were still crushed by her hands. Under threat from our general, who threatened \"cooperate with me having sex in your capital, or I will trample every city on your planet,” the local giantess leader shamefully stood up, took off her panties, and unbuttoned her blouse, exposing her small hole and nipples to high above the busy city area.\n\nMassive dildos weighing hundreds of tons completely filled the enemy giantess's small hole, causing her lower abdomen to swell and tremble. Tremendous vibrations mixed with the sounds of overflowing sexual fluids spread, causing terror to the small people of the city which caused them to scatter in all directions. The enemy giantess shamefully used her hands to hold the exit of her honeypot in fear of those dildos falling and damaging the fragile city under her. However, the erotic liquid that still flowed was already spreading across the local capital; the sweet liquid covered the busy streets and drowned countless small people, who slowly stopped struggling in the warm liquid with its rich scent. At the same time, our giantess general seized the opportunity to attack the enemy’s unprepared, full breasts with her nimble hands. The enemy's nipples uncontrollably became erect. The pure white milk which was meant to water the planet now began to spray into the city without restraint. Upon being hit by the powerful stream of mother milk, those tall buildings were all cut in half, becoming piles of rubble soaking in breast milk. Unlucky… or perhaps lucky small people, those splashed by the stream of breast milk directly turned into streaks of blood mist mixed into the drinkable milk. \n\nThe anger in the local giantess leader's heart was slowly replaced by an inability to release her lust. The fingers that were plugging her small hole had already started to twitch involuntarily, stimulating her erect clitoris. And her body also began to cling to our conqueror, completely ignoring that her spraying milk and overflowing love fluids had already killed tens of thousands of small people. Finally, the unavoidable moment came. With a shriek that shattered all the windows in the city, she knelt on the ground like a small asteroid impact, sweeping across the buildings that had not collapsed with her voluptuous breasts, crushing them all in a lake of breast milk and love fluids dozens of meters deep. Her lower body had finally welcomed the long-awaited climax. Those huge dildos, along with the gush of fluids, were ejected like cannonballs, hitting the original prosperous capital of the planet chaotically. Even after touching the ground, the dildos covered in love fluids were still trembling and bouncing, shattering more buildings to dust or mud mixed with erotic scents.\n\nMinutes later, everything returned to calm. A third of the planet’s capital region had been completely destroyed, not because of the conqueror's violence, but because of the original guardian’s lust. Tear of humiliation dripped from the local giantess leader's eyes, falling into the lake of carnal desire which had so much commemorative meaning. This vast lake probably won’t be removed by small people for a very long time."

  gts_event_qhai.33.title: "Violating Surrender Ceremony"
  gts_event_qhai.33.desc: "Whether it was the enemy intentionally delaying their inevitable defeat, or whether they were simply too scared by our giantesses to move, we had been waiting at the designated location for two hours, but the enemy surrender representative had still not appeared. Our general had already become impatient. The massive dick, hanging underneath her short skirt by her as long as her forearm, had already pushed her white panties down, and stood upright out from the short skirt which already only served a decorative purpose. This shows that the formal surrender ceremony was completely unnecessary. Our general went straight to the enemy's capital, picked up the enemy giantess leader, who was still hesitating, and without caring about her weak kicking, she went straight into the busy city area. The fragile high-rise buildings and busy streets instantly turned into scraps under her huge military boots. But the damage compared to what was about to come was completely negligible.\n\nThe enemy giantess leader was thrown into the city center by our general. She looked in terror at that massive dick, as thick as a forearm, hitting her straight in the face. Although she tried her best to resist, the inevitable conclusion finally arrived. The penis entered her mouth with force and jammed straight down her throat, wildly crashing around. Feelings of suffocation and nausea occurred in turns, but had it not been for the fact that the giantess did not need to breathe, and had an extremely strong body, it was estimated that she would already have died several times during this rough blowjob. As for the collapsed buildings and the small people crushed by her butt and thighs in the city center, it wasn't possible to care about them. Our futa giantess's ejaculation arrived all at once. The white, turbid liquid that gushed out directly filled her never-satisfied stomach, and shot out from her throat, mouth, and nostrils, spraying the fluid up to ten kilometers across within the area. The entire city was filled with the smell of offal, before it unceremoniously drenched the local leader, soaking her beautiful long hair and neat uniform in the white ejaculate.\n\nHowever, this was just an appetizer. Our general ripped off the other’s top and pantyhose, covering her magnificent breasts with dripping semen. Then, the massive penis that had never stopped being erect, being covered in rubble and thousands of surviving small people, was forcibly stuffed into the enemy’s small hole. The local giantess leader was forced to face down on the ground. As she was being held down, her voluptuous breasts pushed through the ground's buildings, pavement, and even the underground shelters. Countless small people, who were unable to escape became streaks of fresh red blood on her erect nipples. And as the breast milk squirted out, the land was plowed into two slightly reddish milk rivers. The local giantess leader's unblemished uterus was now being directly invaded by the huge penis. The small people who were rolled into her vagina directly disappeared in the blood of her broken hymen. Some others, who were luckier, were crushed at the cervix. A select few individuals who had luckily been jammed into the entrance to her urethra were, along with the violent thrusts, directly stuffed into her sacred uterus along with the tip of the penis. Then ejaculation arrived, and along with the millions of sperm, they were permanently left in the enemy’s womb, where their lives had begun. The mass amount of semen was so much that the local giantess's abdomen bulged as if she was pregnant. As the penis was pulled from her lower body, it was then shoved into her rear, and the semen in her uterus was squeezed out as if by a pump. Next was her vagina, and then her rear, switching back and forth like this...\n\nUntil dusk, our general finally ran out of strength. She and her former enemy laid in the capital that was now completely in ruins. Several kilometers deep, and covered in sperm and love fluid, the ruins of the city were almost completely submerged. Our general, for the first time that day, kissed and gently licked the face of her poor enemy, a face that was covered in semen and that looked lost. Her enemy, however, had long lost consciousness, unable to respond to this delayed tenderness. As the star disappeared over the horizon, the two of them quietly fell asleep on the city that was now dyed in silver, just as peacefully as if they were sleeping on a large bed in a luxurious hotel room – and only the last few tens of thousands of surviving small people were slowly drowning in this warm and sweet bed sheet."
