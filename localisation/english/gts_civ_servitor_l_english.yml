  #Tiny Protector? (by OrangeJuice)
  gts_civ_servitor.1000.name: "Tiny Protector?"
  gts_civ_servitor.1000.desc: "The giantess stepped over the diligent teacher and carefully picked up the little boy.\n\"Would you like to come home with big sis?\"\nThe little boy hesitated, either in fear or uncertainty, and didn't reply immediately. ~Boom~ The giant boot crushed where the teacher stood, erasing them from sight.\n\n\"Teacher!\" the boy cried, tears flowing as he asked, \"Why, big sis, why did you...\"\n\"It's your fault, you know?\" the giantess said while petting the tiny thing. \"If you had agreed to come home with me sooner, this wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nShe softly stepped on the adjacent school building, raising her foot afterward.\n\"So, will you come home with big sis?\" The school was filled with the boy's friends and classmates.\n\"I understand now!\" the boy nodded frantically, \"I'll go with big sis, and I'll be good. Please, don't hurt them...\"\n\"Good boy~ See, wouldn't things have been better if you'd agreed from the start?\"\n\nThe giantess ruffled his hair and tucked him between her ample bosom, leaving a terrifyingly close-escaped teacher under her high heel to watch her retreating form with trepidation."
