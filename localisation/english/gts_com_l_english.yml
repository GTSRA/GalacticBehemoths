Each pop has the §Y same §! productivity, but the number of people corresponding to the same pop is very different. In this mod, one Titan pop corresponds to one Titan Giantess, and a normal size pop corresponds to 500 million normal people. That is to say, §Y one §! Titan Giantess's §Y daily §! productivity is equivalent to §Y 1.36 million §! ordinary people's §Y yearly §! productivity. If it's a microbe, the actual production gap is even greater!\n\n§BQ: Why can only one Shipgirl be built?§! \nA: Because each Shipgirl is §Y special §! and her strength is §Y hundreds of times §! that of a normal ship. In future updates, more Shipgirls may be added, so stay tuned."
