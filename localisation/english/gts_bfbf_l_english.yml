  # First Contact - Unfinished
  gts_bfbf.2.name: ""
  gts_bfbf.2.desc: "Following the initial contact, the first substantive meeting between the two civilizations is scheduled.\n\nThe meeting location is chosen to be on a satellite of [capital_star]. Despite having received their size data beforehand, revealing how gigantic [from] is, the diplomats still doubt whether they were truly prepared when they actually see them. Vehicles the size of small cities dock in the gravity belt, and the shadows cast by the giant ships blot out the sky. As the hatch slowly opens, the rumbling footsteps herald this historic meeting.\n\n'Oh? [owner_main_species]'... So you're just a bunch of little cuties!'\n\nThe arrogant tone rumbles like thunder, accompanied by a gust of wind that nearly knocks us over. A massive high heel lifts and then slams down, the ground beneath it deeply cratering. Everyone present involuntarily bends over. The leading giantess slowly raises her right leg, the lifted heel brushing against the surrounding decorations, instantly destroying a row of signs, and a whirlwind of dust fills the air.\n\nSubsequently, more gigantic figures descend from the sky, their long skirts billowing and obscuring the heavens, their haughty laughter booming like bass drums into our eardrums—these are the giantess's envoys, arrogantly and contemptuously overlooking the panicked little people at their feet. Thick black stockings encase thighs thicker than houses, the barely visible sweat reflecting a faint light, and a strong, pungent, fishy odor mixes with the scent of perfume, permeating the air.\n\nOne of them raises a finger painted with red nail polish, idly scrolling through her phone. That hand alone is truly enormous, three stories tall, with nails the size of ordinary houses. Her every step brings a thunderous roar, and the ground trembles slightly. That stocking-clad thigh is as thick as a skyscraper, exuding a strong, sweaty stench.\n\nConsidering that a single one of them possesses the destructive power of an elite mobile squad, despite our deployment of sufficient armed forces, the diplomats are still deeply worried about the upcoming meeting."
  gts_bfbf.2.a: "Too dangerous, we should hold a video conference!"
  gts_bfbf.2.a1: "Capital stability decreased for 5 years."
  gts_bfbf.2.b: "We must not show weakness, continue with face-to-face talks!"
  gts_bfbf.2.b1: "In any case, they've already come to our territory. The arrow is on the string and must be fired. Retreating would undoubtedly be a sign of weakness."

  gts_bfbf.3.desc: "These gigantic maidens all look down upon everyone on the ground. Their tall, sexy bodies cast shadows, completely obscuring the small honor guard. During the entrance, one of them accidentally crushed a small spaceship parked by the roadside into a pancake—it was as if she had unintentionally stepped on an ant.\n\nSuccessive, massive footsteps boom, and the ground vibrates violently under this gigantic force. Although we designed a special path for ourselves, it now feels more like a 'door' for mice. But the violent shaking still shocks everyone present—not to mention that the so-called '[owner_main_species] seats,' a huge conference hall, are only the size of a few boxes for these giantesses.\n\nThe rich scent of giantess is indeed very alluring. The fermentation of foot sweat mixes with the fragrance, and the female hormones are aggressive and conquering. The entire conference room gradually fills with an atmosphere that induces kneeling and submission.\n\nOur vision is extremely obstructed, and the diplomats can only look up at the lower bodies of the giantesses—those in the front row have their entire field of vision occupied by ankles. The calves are as thick as ordinary skyscrapers, with smooth and beautiful lines, and the muscles of the calves ripple slightly with their movements. The fibers of the stockings shimmer alluringly under the lights, and the thighs wrapped in black stockings exude a faint, sweaty scent. Occasionally, when they cross their legs, the stockings make a creaking sound, and the undulation of those muscles becomes even more pronounced.\n\n'I really want to lick those thighs, and every drop of fragrant sweat on her feet...'\n'The original fluid of giantesses is priceless on the black market. I've never tasted the true sweat of a giantess before. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...'\n\nFaced with giantesses who have the upper hand in both size and strength, our officials are losing ground at the negotiating table, and their aura is becoming increasingly humble. Now, many officials with perverted minds have given up struggling and are instead thinking about 'other aspects' of the situation."
  gts_bfbf.3.a: "Small people encountering giantesses naturally cannot win no matter how hard they try. We only hope to value harmony."
  gts_bfbf.3.a1: "Giantess fluid production increases in the capital within 5 years, but stability decreases."
  gts_bfbf.3.b: "Daring to do this is no ordinary diplomat; we must strike hard!"
  gts_bfbf.3.b1: "This group of perverted guys are obviously a bunch of people who only know how to throw away their lives. They think about surrendering at the first sign of disadvantage. We must come down hard on this group of people!"
  gts_bfbf.4.name: ""
  gts_bfbf.4.desc: "Well-trained airborne troops quickly arrive on the scene, and to the giantesses' surprise, they 'shake' these vermin with teeth-grinding force before dragging them out of the venue. This little episode clearly disrupts the rhythm of the giantesses, and our well-trained debaters take the opportunity to step up. The meeting finally concludes with a result that is not too bad.\n\nAnd when they leave, the giantesses seem accustomed to this, but today's outcome is somewhat 'unexpected but reasonable.' The leader seems very satisfied and proposes a 'talent show'—at the cost of 'consuming' those vermin who were dragged out.\n\nOf course, we can't refuse such a good thing.\n\nThe struggling officials are thrown into stockings that are still steaming, and the thick, fermented, sour and stinky mist brought by the long journey instantly envelops them. Before they can figure out what's happening, they look up, but all they can see is an endless crisscross of black fibers. As the rustling sound spreads, the camera we placed inside shows that the slowly approaching flesh color is a huge, sky-covering foot. Just one toe is as big as a civilian small aircraft, not to mention that the giantess has already extended her entire foot inside!\n\n'No! Save me!'\n\nThe wailing comes clearly from the big screen, and everyone present, whether [owner] or [from], looks at this visual feast. Between the huge foot extending into the stocking, she first lifts her toes slightly, tilting them to let the little people roll to the heel, and then, taking advantage of the situation, she steps down, '噗呲' sound, and with just one movement of the heel, the huge gravity instantly crushes the little people inside into a bloody paste. The blood and mud, along with fragments of bones and internal organs, splatter, but only dye the heel a bit of red.\n\nSome lucky ones grab the seams of the stockings, hanging in the stockings like climbers.\n\n'You want to get out alive after getting into the stockings? You want to have it all?'\n\nWith a gentle pinch of the stockings, a movement of lifting the stockings, the snow-white arch of the foot presses against the little people in the middle. The fleshy skin is accompanied by the tight stockings, and the huge pressure soon squeezes the last bit of air out of the little people's lungs, instantly exploding under the arch of the foot, so that they can't even breathe a trace of foot odor.\n\nThe little people at the very end of the stockings, that is, between the toes, undoubtedly suffer the worst torment. At the end of their rope, they kneel before the giantess's toes, trying to beg for mercy from our camera, but no one pities them. The toes playfully pinch the little people, rubbing and rubbing them. The little people's bodies are first folded directly backward under the huge force, and then twisted into a pool of blood and mud. The few in the toe seams suffer the same fate, and with just a movement of the toes, they turn into the dead souls under the giantess's feet.\n\nThe 'talent show' is over. The giantess nods to everyone present, and amidst the envious gazes of her colleagues, she pours out a few things that seem to be still alive from the stockings and throws them into her boots, and then asks us...\n\n'Hey, little things, want some souvenirs?'"
  gts_bfbf.4.a: "The blood-stained stockings on the left foot will surely warn our people."
  gts_bfbf.4.a1: "Capital planet stability increased for 5 years."
  gts_bfbf.4.b: "The dirty and sweaty stockings on the right foot mark the beginning of a friendship."
  gts_bfbf.6.name: ""
  gts_bfbf.6.desc: "The meeting place is arranged in a super-clean laboratory on §I[Root.capital_star.GetName]§!. Although our biologists have conducted detailed discussions and even prepared three alternative plans, for these civilizations smaller than microorganisms... accidents still happen.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that there are civilizations in the universe as tiny as microorganisms. You know, even a single fiber of our stockings is as thick as a train for §Y[from.owner_main_species.GetName]§!. The 'reception center' that was carefully built under a microscope throughout the process is not even the size of a flake of skin.\n\nWill §Y[from.GetName]§! be willing to come—but forced by the size difference of our §Y[owner.GetName]§!, they have to come.\n\nThe first meeting made the other party realize the gap between us. Due to disinfection errors, a few yeasts were still missed—and launched an attack on the unprepared [from.GetName]. The firepower of the accompanying guards quickly solved those microorganisms. A subsequent investigation revealed that a scientist violated regulations by wearing slippers and stockings while assembling the welcome station, and those yeasts floated into... the other party's room along with the evaporation of foot sweat.\n\nAlthough I know I can't do this on a formal occasion, do you know that those little figures were raided by several bacteria bigger than them, and those who ran slowly were directly swallowed by the bacteria as food—and then the guards who were one step slower even fought back and forth with several yeasts, and all of this can only be seen under our microscope, which is even funnier!\n\nSeveral officials proposed to let the other party 'visit us up close,' and §Y[from.GetName]§! protested against this after the incident just now. We need to seek your opinion."
  gts_bfbf.6.a: "Respect the other party's opinion."
  gts_bfbf.6.a1: "End event."
  gts_bfbf.6.b: "You must do as the Romans do; they have no choice."
  gts_bfbf.6.b1: "Meeting will continue."
  gts_bfbf.7.name: ""
  gts_bfbf.7.desc: "A winding, twisting labyrinth of flesh, the pink and white giant walls are four or five people tall. The [from] group slowly moves forward on the translucent gelatinous ground.\n\nAlthough the other party has ten thousand protests, how can they get angry at us? You know, this is our territory, just the fingerprints of one of our envoys. It's not a problem, right? This envoy volunteered herself. We learned that this girl is the leader of the language team. She worked overtime a lot when she was previously deciphering the other party's shitty language structure and incomprehensible garbage music. Now, this envoy took the initiative to let them... visit herself.\n\n'If you can get to the middle of the fingertip, I'll let you go, little things~'\n\nBut faced with the huge size difference that a finger can hold a stadium, just crossing the girl's finger is already a long journey, not to mention that the other party is now trapped in the fingerprint labyrinth of the fingertip.\n\nHowever, who told the creators to give them such a small body?\n\nThe picture from the micro-camera gradually blurs, and there is a '啪叽啪叽' sound under the feet of the little people. The girl's fingertips only sweat a little, the kind that she doesn't even notice, but for the little people, it's a hot, wet puddle that has passed their feet. Millions of [owner]'s citizens are watching the wonderful journey of §Y[from.owner_main_species.GetName]§! in front of the live broadcast terminal. For a while, the orders for civilian microscopes on major platforms were directly sold out.\n\nThe other party proposed to end this unpleasant tour, but our envoy suddenly asked to cut off the live broadcast with a flushed face. The decision is again in your hands..."
  gts_bfbf.7.a: "Let them go when you've had enough fun."
  gts_bfbf.7.a1: "Obtain £energy£ Energy Credits and end the event."
  gts_bfbf.7.b: "Oops, the live broadcast room accidentally lost its internet connection..."
  gts_bfbf.7.b1: "What will happen?"
  gts_bfbf.8.name: ""
  gts_bfbf.8.desc: "Obviously, the linguistic difficulties encountered during decryption have made this envoy bear a grudge, and the girl's desire for revenge and lust are about to descend on this group of microorganisms at this moment. After confirming that the live broadcast was 'accidentally interrupted,' the girl's other hand directly tore off her panties and inserted the finger carrying dozens of [对方主体种族] into her flower cave with a '咕啾' sound...\n\n'Hoo... ah...'\n\nPleasure and blushing '咕叽咕叽' sounds filled the room. The girl shouted things like 'Be eaten by the little mouths below me,' while speeding up the pace and intensity of her masturbation—and at the same time, the other party's camera was still on, so we could watch this farce well from the terminal inside the portable fiber.\n\nThe flesh lips spanning the sky opened with a '啪叽' sound, pulling a few silver threads, and the pink that covered the sky swallowed all sight. The city-sized fingers violently thrusted, and the unprepared little people were thrown into the endless vagina. The lucky ones may land on the mountain-like vaginal folds, while more can only be thrown into the ocean of love liquid like an endless ocean. The mucus gathered into towering waves dozens of stories high, and then, under the thrust of the fingers, with a loud bang, the little people struggling for survival in the ocean of mucus were swept into the 'seabed'!\n\nLove liquid gurgled out, perhaps with a few corpses of unlucky people inside, or a few lucky ones spurted out with the tide of love liquid, humbly clinging to the inner thighs, under the pubic hair, or inside the panties—or are those tiny bodies already reduced to inconspicuous red dots under this so viscous and hot wave?\n\nAfter all, a drop of fluid from us [owner_main_species] is already a super lake that can carry countless people for them.\n\nAnd this envoy, who hasn't had enough perversion, obviously doesn't care about the lives of this group of microorganisms. After panting for a few breaths, she plans to come again. It seems that the opposite envoys are not even more powerful than the bacteria in her vagina, after all, the latter really protests and lives by secreting substances, and causes some small troubles to this girl.\n\nHowever, the life detector shows that some love liquid was splashed out during the orgasm just now, and a few microbial lucky ones fell on their toes with the help of air flotation, so they still have a breath, depending on whether you want to save them or not."
  gts_bfbf.8.a: "Now that things have come to this, saving people is the most important thing."
  gts_bfbf.8.a1: ""
  gts_bfbf.8.b: "What, are you reminding me to zoom in on the camera?"
  gts_bfbf.8.b1: "Continue event."
  gts_bfbf.9.name: ""
  gts_bfbf.9.desc: "It seems that this envoy usually doesn't take good care of her feet. The dry, dead skin on her toes curled up between unintentional frictions while walking. For the 'microorganisms' that landed on it, it was obviously a continuous range of yellow and white mountains.\n\nThe several [from] microbial little people who landed on the toes were obviously stunned. They didn't understand what the place was. The surface of the planet was covered with white, undulating mountains, and a strange flesh-colored arc was revealed on the horizon. At the end of the line of sight, there seemed to be four other rounded, flesh-colored horizons.\n\nSoon, a more serious problem was placed in front of them. The sour and stinky foot sweat had already enveloped the atmosphere of the 'toes' topography where they were located. The strange smell made the survivors present show difficulty—but this was nothing compared to the difficulties they would face next.\n\nFor these few microorganisms, it's wilderness survival. For the indigenous microorganisms, it's simply a gift from nature.\n\nA group of white dumplings more than two people tall swayed and slowly approached, and several flagella-waving miscellaneous bacteria in the distance were also leaning up. The surviving lucky ones huddled on a higher foot skin dandruff mountain. Without weapons, they used foot dirt and fiber fragments to make the most primitive tools, hoping to survive the next wave of attacks from the foot bacteria and avoid becoming nutrients for these microorganisms.\n\nPerhaps in a few decades, these guys can develop a new sub-lightspeed civilization on their toes?\n\nThis diplomatic event has come to an end. This girl was demoted to a temporary worker, but she is happy to receive a generous compensation bonus. Our diplomat reminded her to remember to wash her feet after returning home—it's good for her and the microbial civilization.\n\nAs for whether this girl listens or not, it's her own business, and we have no right to interfere."

  d_shit_ruin6: "Soft Feces"
  d_shit_ruin6_desc: "The soft feces subsequently excreted by the giantess. After the most stuffy hard feces were excreted, the soft feces that had not yet been formed by intestinal compression escaped like a mountain torrent and tsunami, giving this giantess's excretion journey a happy ending while instantly submerging the more vast land under her."
  d_shit_ruin7: "Urine Lake"

  d_shit_ruin7_desc: "The lake formed by the urine pouring out of the giantess's urethra on the ground. The strong acidity has designated tens of kilometers around as a forbidden zone.
