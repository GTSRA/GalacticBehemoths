 # §r帝国类型§!
 policy_gts_empire_type:0 "§rEmpire Type§!"
 # 帝国类型是我们的政治基石，这决定了整个帝国的在内政外交方面的定位
 policy_gts_empire_type_desc:0 "Empire Type is our political cornerstone, determining the empire's positioning in domestic and foreign affairs."
 # §Y天体帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_ultra:0 "§YCelestial Empire§!"
 # 这种帝国的存在本身便是一种威胁，她们的国民本身就比星体巨大，倘若她们对其他帝国发起军事行动，那即便是派出最为精锐的舰队恐怕都无法拦住一个她们的普通国民\n\n她们的发展潜力我们无法估计，但她们为发展要付出的代价对我们而言绝对是一个天文数字
 gts_empire_type_ultra_desc:0 "The existence of this empire is a threat itself. Its citizens are larger than stars. If they launch military operations, even the most elite fleets cannot stop a single ordinary citizen.\n\nTheir potential is immeasurable, but the cost of development is astronomical for us."
 # §R泰坦帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_titan:0 "§RTitan Empire§!"
 # 这种帝国在寰宇间极为罕见，尽管她们的国民数量稀少，但仅仅只是几个她们的国民就足够威慑住体型比她们小的帝国的军队\n\n星球的地貌对帝国而言是可以轻易重塑的玩物、敌人的舰队可轻易被他们粉碎\n\n她们的发展潜力不容小觑，但她们要为发展付出的代价也更加高昂
 gts_empire_type_titan_desc:0 "Rare in the universe. Though few in number, a few citizens are enough to deter armies of smaller empires.\n\nPlanetary terrain is a plaything to reshape; enemy fleets are easily crushed.\n\nTheir potential is significant, but development costs are high."
 # §S巨型帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_giant:0 "§SGiant Empire§!"
 # 这种帝国在寰宇间的数量稀少，依靠帝国国民百米之高的体型，帝国能够以极小的代价轻易粉碎一切体型小于她们的敌人\n\n同样，巨大的体型让帝国的发展潜力远高于体型小的帝国，尽管代价要更加高昂
 gts_empire_type_giant_desc:0 "Rare in the universe. With citizens hundreds of meters tall, they can crush smaller enemies with minimal cost.\n\nGiant size means higher potential than smaller empires, though costs are higher."
 # §M大型帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_tall:0 "§MTall Empire§!"
 # 这类帝国的数量在星间相比标准帝国而言较少，但她们的国民体型依照星间标准通常都有几米到几十米，但这也意味着帝国的维持成本更大\n\n更大的体型让她们能够在星间四处凄凉那些更小的帝国，但遇到体型更大的帝国时，她们又回到了被欺凌者的身份
 gts_empire_type_tall_desc:0 "Fewer than standard empires. Citizens are meters to tens of meters tall, meaning higher maintenance costs.\n\nLarger size allows them to bully smaller empires, but they become victims when facing larger ones."
 # §B标准型帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_normal:0 "§BStandard Empire§!"
 # 这一类的帝国是寰宇间最常见的帝国，他们的国民的体型最为标准，标准的体型让她们的帝国通常充当体型更大的帝国和微型帝国间沟通的中间人
 gts_empire_type_normal_desc:0 "The most common empire type. Standard size makes them intermediaries between larger and micro empires."
 # §G矮人型帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_small:0 "§GSmall Empire§!"
 # 这一类帝国在寰宇间的数量与标准帝国齐平，但碍于她们的国民体型仅有标准帝国的一半不到，她们在各种场合都只能充当标准帝国的陪衬甚至附庸\n\n但这样的体型也为她们带来了便利，在各种场合上她们往往能够出其不意的制造一些“惊喜”
 gts_empire_type_small_desc:0 "As common as standard empires. With citizens half the size of standard ones, they serve as foils or subjects.\n\nBut their size brings convenience; they can often create 'surprises'."
 # §T微小型帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_tiny:0 "§TTiny Empire§!"
 # 这类帝国在寰宇间的数量极多，但考虑到她们的国民体型仅有几厘米不到，所以数量并不能为她们带来足够的优势\n\n与其将她们称作帝国，倒不如将她们称作玩具国家，毕竟她们的发展潜力与各方面的效率都低的可怜\n\n但和低效带来的低成本相比，这些低效率似乎都不算什么了
 gts_empire_type_tiny_desc:0 "Very common. Citizens are a few centimeters tall. Numbers don't give enough advantage.\n\nRather than an empire, they are toy nations. Development potential and efficiency are pitifully low.\n\nBut compared to low costs, low efficiency seems acceptable."
 # §g细菌帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_micro:0 "§gMicro Empire§!"
 # 与其说她们是一种文明，倒不如说是细菌成了精\n\n这类帝国的存在可能仅仅只需占据星间的某个犄角旮旯，她们的国民可能会被人误认为是细菌而被轻易杀灭\n\n尽管她们极为脆弱，但微小的体型也赋予了她们顽强的生命，帝国往往会在毁灭中又一次复苏，重获崭新的生命\n但……这样的帝国能否在星间获得一席之地，这点值得怀疑
 gts_empire_type_micro_desc:0 "Less a civilization, more like sentient bacteria.\n\nThey occupy corners of the galaxy, easily mistaken for germs and killed.\n\nThough fragile, their size gives tenacity. They often recover from destruction.\nBut... can such an empire gain a place in the stars? Doubtful."
 # §L分子帝国§!
 gts_empire_type_nano:0 "§LNano Empire§!"
 # 这种帝国的存在可能仅仅只需要占据一个小小的细胞，我们很难判断她们为何能够到达宇宙之中，但我们可以确定，这种帝国完全就是一个可被微生物中的少女肆意蹂躏的帝国\n\n很难想象她们在星间究竟要依靠什么来发展，但她们同样是不容小觑的敌人，毕竟这样微小的体型完全能让她们爆发出我们无法想象的潜能
 gts_empire_type_nano_desc:0 "They may occupy just a cell. It's hard to judge how they reached space, but they are definitely an empire to be ravaged by microbial maidens.\n\nHard to imagine how they develop, but they are not to be underestimated. Such small size unleashes unimaginable potential."
 # §r帝国对巨娘政策方针§!
 policy_gts_giantess_treatment:0 "§rGiantess Policy§!"
 # 帝国对巨娘的政策方针会影响帝国境内这些巨娘的命运以及可选政策
 policy_gts_giantess_treatment_desc:0 "Affects the fate of Giantesses in the empire and available policies."
 # 友善
 gts_giantess_treatment_positive:0 "Friendly"
 # 小人们崇拜巨娘，被她们的美丽与力量所折服\n帝国内的巨娘受到小人们超规格的礼遇，为巨娘服务的工作也受到人们的尊重\n一些巨娘干脆沉迷于小人们的侍奉之中变成了只会涩涩的废人，其他的巨娘也许会对一些，嗯…过于热情的小人感到不安
 gts_giantess_treatment_positive_desc:0 "Small folk worship Giantesses, awed by their beauty and power.\nGiantesses receive extraordinary treatment. Service jobs for them are respected.\nSome Giantesses become useless perverts addicted to service; others feel uneasy about the... excessive enthusiasm."
 # 中立
 gts_giantess_treatment_neutral:0 "Neutral"
 # 小人们对于巨娘的情感总体来说是十分复杂的，一方面崇拜她们的天生神力，另一方面也畏惧这种力量会导致毁灭，因此他们对于巨娘的态度总是有所保留\n\n巨娘在这样的社会里需要谨慎行事，过度的展示自己的存在或许会带来负作用
 gts_giantess_treatment_neutral_desc:0 "Small folk have mixed feelings: worshipping power but fearing destruction. Their attitude is reserved.\n\nGiantesses must be cautious. Excessive display of existence may backfire."
 # 敌对
 gts_giantess_treatment_hostile:0 "Hostile"
 # 对巨大生物的恐惧已经深深植入小人的内心深处，小人们会尽可能与巨娘保持距离，与巨娘打交道的小人会被视为异端与叛徒\n\n即使一般情况下小人很难伤害到巨娘，但如果巨娘的性格比较软弱，还是会被这些小家伙骑在头上欺负
 gts_giantess_treatment_hostile_desc:0 "Fear of giant creatures is deep-rooted. Small folk keep their distance. Those dealing with Giantesses are seen as heretics.\n\nThough hard to hurt, weak-willed Giantesses might be bullied by these little guys."
 # §r帝国对小人政策方针§!
 policy_gts_tiny_treatment:0 "§rSmall Folk Policy§!"
 # 帝国对小人的政策方针会影响帝国境内这些小人的命运以及可选政策
 policy_gts_tiny_treatment_desc:0 "Affects the fate of small folk in the empire and available policies."
 # 友善
 gts_tiny_treatment_positive:0 "Friendly"
 # 巨娘们乐意与这些可爱的小家伙们和平共处，对小人的虐待行为会受到全社会的谴责\n\n在如此友善的社会环境下，小人们可以过上一个相对体面的生活，唯一的坏处是与巨娘过于亲密的贴贴有时也会产生一些意料之外的后果…
 gts_tiny_treatment_positive_desc:0 "Giantesses live peacefully with these cute little guys. Abuse is condemned.\n\nSmall folk live a decent life. The only downside is that intimate contact sometimes has... unexpected consequences."
 # 中立
 gts_tiny_treatment_neutral:0 "Neutral"
 # 或许是对于小人的存在并不在意，又或许是社会对小人的态度两级分化，总之巨娘们对小家伙们的态度模棱两可\n\n故意伤害小人用于取乐的行为在某种程度上被默许，只有在事情做太过火的时候才会受到指责\n\n在这种社会氛围里生存的小人只能自求多福，祈祷自己能不要遇到那些心性残忍的巨娘
 gts_tiny_treatment_neutral_desc:0 "Maybe they don't care about small folk, or society is indifferent."
 # 敌对
 gts_tiny_treatment_hostile:0 "Hostile"
 # 小人在巨娘们的眼里只不过是一群恶心的虫豸，杀死它们不会带来任何的负罪感，有些巨娘们甚至以折磨和虐杀小人为乐\n\n这样的社会环境对于小人来说是真正的地狱，想要活下去的小人只能凭借异乎寻常的胆量与运气，在巨娘世界的夹缝中求生
 gts_tiny_treatment_hostile_desc:0 "In the eyes of Giantesses, small people are just a group of disgusting bugs. Killing them will not bring any guilt. Some Giantesses even take pleasure in torturing and killing small people.\n\nSuch a social environment is a real hell for small people. Small people who want to survive can only rely on extraordinary courage and luck to survive in the cracks of the Giantess world."
