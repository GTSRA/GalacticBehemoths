  gts_focus_crisis_description_title: "Path of God Removal"
  gts_focus_crisis_description_intro: "In the Huge and Moe universe, small people are constantly bullied by giantesses. They conquer, they enslave, they kill. Conquest and resistance are the main themes of the entire universe.\n\nThroughout history, it is not as though there have been no small people and giantesses trying to coexist peacefully. Once, a powerful gentle giantess led a civilization of small people to traverse the universe, and almost all star systems were under her rule. At that time, small people and giantesses were equal, and no one would have their rights taken away by a larger being because of their size. Under the cooperation and development of small people and giantesses, the §YGolden Age§! arrived.\n\nBut a “§RGoddes§!” outside the universe was not happy to see the giantesses and small people living in harmony. She wanted to see rivers of blood, so she forcibly interfered with this universe. Even with the resources of the entire universe and assembling the military power of entire universe to resist, her body never even received a single scratch. The super-civilization collapsed in an instant, and the gentle giantess was taken to become her servant. In order to provoke the relationship between giantesses and small people, the 'Goddess' gave a small portion of her divine power to all the giantesses, making them more cruel while they became stronger. In order to manage the infinite amount of universes, she took away talented giantesses as her servants and instilled divine power. These servants became the new rulers of the universe and were called §PGod-Maidens§!. The gentle giantess was one of the God-Maidens. After that, the giantesses wantonly bullied the small people, and any resistance from the small people was immediately suppressed by the God-Maidens. A darker age arrived."
  gts_focus_crisis_description: "$gts_focus_crisis_description_intro$\n\nBut there is still light in the endless darkness. A device called the “§YDivine Power Purifier§!“ can remove the mind-altering module in divine power. While making the giantesses gentler, it can also provide us with the excess divine power for our own use. Together, we will usher in the second §YGolden Age§!."
  gts_focus_crisis_howto_title: "\"§RGoddes§!\" and Focus"
  gts_focus_crisis_howto: "§RThe \"Goddess\"§! is a super giantess who controls many universes and has power beyond all imagination. The success rate of armed confrontation is infinitely close to 0. Fortunately, she spends most of her energy on pursuing pleasure, and the management of the universes is delegated to the God-Maidens. While the God-Maidens are powerful, they do not have the time to focus on the events happening in one of the infinite universes. We can prepare before they find us.\nComplete §HFocus Objectives§! to generate £gts_focus£§HFocus§!, which will cause her to apply more divine power to our universe. Then, we use the §YDivine Power Purifier§! to claim it for ourselves."

Indeed, for her empire, their queen was the living, breathing Great Wall.\n\nAnd yet now, that Wall of Flesh and blood is about to roar defiance at injustice, and throw a star-piercing spear at fate.\n\n§P\"Father, I hate creators! Although scientists tell us that humans evolved from ancient apes... although ancient apes don't sound very good, and although our home planet is not the center of the universe, and we are not the chosen rulers of destiny, at least we don't have to worry about so-called fate! We don't have to be afraid that we live in a pathetic petri dish!\"§!\n\n§P\"There is no such thing as a perfect species, all living things make mistakes. Desire is a commonality of all life, it is original sin, but also the source of innovation and progress. If the reason for having a species destroyed and restarted is because it is imperfect, then no matter how many times it is repeated, the same results will be obtained. True evolution is collective, reaching a consensus in error, and overcoming the evils derived from nature. The gods who consider themselves high and noble and wield their butcher's knives against the weak, are just ignorant and brutal beasts.\"§!\n\nAlmost infinite divine power pours into Yaorong's body, making you wonder if your child can bear such power - this is powerful energy that can tear the separation between the void and reality!\n\n………………\n\n§R\"Specimen 115 is fluctuating; a suspected warp phenomenon is occurring, please resolve the anomaly as soon as possible. If necessary, you can opt to restart the petri dish.\"§!\n\nA cold female voice was heard from above many of the petri dishes. Along with the voice came a finger as green as jade.\n\nThe fluctuation of the petri dish intensified, but the God-Maiden didn't care - the civilizations in those petri dishes had already gone through so much to discover that they lived in petri dishes in the first place, and, that Universe 115 was even able to use the divine power left by the Goddess in order to achieve a warp was even more rare.\n\nUnfortunately, this was rare for the God-Maiden for this was not the first of the civilizations she had seen that had escaped to other universes, and most of those civilizations just ran from one petri dish into another - however, this was fortunate.  Civilizations that truly escaped would instead cause the native universe to be stuffed into the Goddess's back garden.\n\nIt wasn't until a ray of light emerged, interrupting the God-Maiden's thoughts and the finger on the verge of landing on the 115th petri dish, that she realized that something was wrong.When she came to her senses, a young woman of similar size, but with an undisguised murderous intent, appeared by her side.\n\nThose golden eyes were filled with incomparable killing intent and hatred. The God-Maiden had seen such looks many times in the eyes of civilizations she had enslaved - and she would always jokingly say that she would throw them into her boots.. But this time it was different, the one next to her was no product of any civilization made for the joy of the other God-Maidens.\n\n§B\"Join us.\"§!\n\nYaorong was clearly stunned, and the God-Maiden was naturally not joking. The number of universes \"governed\" by the Goddess numbered in the thousands, and the several dozen God-Maidens were already close to being overworked. Thus, the chance to find someone that barely made the minimum for God-Maiden certification was such a rare chance that she naturally had to try and pull this little girl over to their side.\n\n§P\"Why? And... on *what* grounds!\"§!\n\nYaorong's face quickly turned murderous again. Her pale hand had already clenched into a fist, ready to restrain the woman in the white coat.\n\n§B\"Your lifeform has already changed. Even if you wanted to return to the petri ... to your original universe now, you wouldn't be able to. You can only join us now.\"§!\n\n§B\"Or be played to death by the Goddess.\"§!\n\nThe God-Maiden saw Yaorong's clenched fist and said in a rather self-defeating manner. She could easily obliterate an entire universe with a finger, but it didn't mean that she could beat this little girl who looked as though she had crawled out of a sea of corpses. To hell with it, she only got paid three galaxies a month for this damn job! Why would she give a damn!\n\n§P\"Father... No, what about the world I used to live in!\"§!\n\nYaorong suddenly lashed out, grabbing the God-Maiden by the collar - Yaorong was  quite tall; she was still in an advantageous position even after taking these actions.\n\nThe God-Maiden who was grabbed by the collar did not express dissatisfaction, but instead she rubbed her temple in frustration before pointing at the original 115 petri dish. The autonomous machine had previously discovered the anomaly from the world of 115, this girl probably ran from there, right? The God-Maiden thought, not caring that Yaorong had already flew over there.\n\nIt was an unremarkable petri dish. The only thing that set it apart from the other petri dishes was a piece of paper at the bottom which read \"115\".\n\nThat was a universe.\n\nThat was her homeland.\n\nThere lived her father, younger sister, friends, and subordinates. But today she could literally hold her entire hometown's nebulae between her fingertips. She couldn't even locate her home world - or rather, where her father was. \n\nEven if she was confused and dazed by her father's size of a star, it was not as significant as when she found that she could hold the entire universe with one hand in petri dish now.. She couldn't really find her father this time.\n\n§B\"Well... it's your property now. Remember not to confuse it with the other civilizations the Goddess sends down – I remember that 60 millennia ago, before God-Maidens were born, they had to completely stomp their native universes before they were born. How did all the young ladies become so emotional now?\"§!\n\nThe God-Maiden on duty patted Yaorong on the shoulders and said nothing more."

  gts_yarong_colossus.110.name: "Calamity Descends"
  gts_yarong_colossus.110.desc: "§P\"Father... Is this the kind of thing you like to watch?\"§!\n\nThe girl smiled wickedly as she looked at the tiny planet beneath her high heels, greeting you as if she were a delinquent girl teasing a fledgling.\n\n§P\" You're becoming more and more unrestrained these days, is it because you no longer manage the Empire?\"§!\n\nYaorong \"sat\" down, took off the black high-heeled shoe from her right foot, and the black stocking that she rarely removed. Then, she pinched the stocking and made a rather cute pose towards the flagship of the Empire, which was where you were situated - however, this posture that would be enough to break the mind of a great void traveler cannot hide her cruelty to come... the Queen of the Empire, she will personally destroy the enemy's planet.\n\nYaorong glanced at the Imperial flagship, as if she had remembered something you once said - instead of directly crushing the small planet with her toes as planned, she instead pointed her foot, that could be considered a work of art, at the Imperial Flagship with a spring-like maiden innocence.\n\nThe most majestic Imperial flagship, comparable in size to a \"Sovereign\" class warship, was like a small grain of sand in front of the girl's \"small\" and delicate toe. In fact, for Yaorong, the biggest difference between the Imperial flagship and a grain of sand was that this small grain of sand held her most beloved person.\n\n§P\"Do you... Would you like to appreciate it?\"§!\n\nWith a teasing tone, Yaorong even playfully wiggled her toes a little...  This was a slightly mischievous movement for a young woman. If she were a normal young woman, such a movement would probably just make you rub her head, even though she was the queen of the empire now - but the reality was that her body covered the sky, even stars could be arbitrarily blocked, and her beautiful feet alone could arbitrarily destroy or play with an entire planet.\n\n§P\"Ah, Father, do you prefer to watch the execution process instead? But that's not too surprising for me...\"§!\n\nYaorong pouted her lips, and after maintaining this \"angry\" expression for no more than two seconds, she showed you her signature smile, like a puppy trying to please its master.\n\n§P\"Then you should appreciate this next scene～\"§!\n\nThe girl used an extremely gentle tone towards you, as she proclaimed the punishment that the civilization that was at war with the empire had to suffer.\n\nEven when making the decision for a \"foot dirt planet transformation\" event, her body would be much smaller than it was now. After all, the great pose of being able to play with a planet between her two toes was prepared for executing enemies.\n\nAnd from the perspective of the enemy, their monitoring observation systems could only see the girl's feet sweeping towards them with a relatively slow but irresistible terror. As Yaorong's foot approached §H[From.GetName]§!, their fleets, mining stations... everything they built outside the planet was destroyed by one of the girl's feet, without even causing a single sensation for her.\n\nYes, if they could let go of their despair and fear and observe, they would be able to find that on Yaorong's feet - to be precise, inside her toe prints - there were still some uncleaned starship wreckage. Everything from the smallest frigate to the most magnificent sovereign, even the colossus had been reduced to a small piece of metal embedded in her toe prints.\n\nFirst, the planet's atmospheric system was destroyed - or rather, it was confiscated. Although your child was quite clean, that did not mean that her body would not secrete bodily fluids after a journey of hundreds of light-years. Thus, in the eyes of the despairing enemy, the atmospheric system that had supported their existence for tens of thousands of years was replaced by the physiological phenomena that the girl produced by \"walking.\"\n\n§P\"Ugh, it shouldn't smell too bad... I hope Father doesn't give me a strange look because of this.\"§!\n\nThe air circulation system had been completely modified, and the resulting cataclysmic change would completely change the course of development of intelligent life on this planet... just like the story about the Poison Sage that you told Yaorong. However, even that legendary deity, the Poison Sage from the void, would probably not be able to modify a planet as easily as your daughter!\n\nIf your child stopped there, maybe the planet would only have its atmosphere modified. A civilization that could invent FTL engines was not incapable of restoring its planet - but all this was based on the premise that your child intended to \"disobey\" your will... She had never done such a thing.\n\nHer enormous toes, like jade, landed on the ocean of §H[From.GetName]§! - and this was also done by Yaorong deliberately. After all, if her toes fell directly on the ground, the continental shelf that was carrying nearly 9 billion lives would probably be turned directly into dirt on her toes. Although that would also be considered an accomplishment of the execution mission...that would have been too boring!\n\nThus, towering waves surged, with volcanoes and gales following one after the other. The magnificent planet that they had spent decades transforming was so powerless in the girl's toes that Yaorong could not even add more pressure, lest the planet be crushed and let the blood of all life on the planet mix with the lava from the earth and soak her toes.\n\n§P\"Ah, it didn't break, right～\"§!\n\nThe girl's voice was still teasing as she only had a slight \"care\" for whether the planet between her toes was destroyed  - she did not crush the planet with her two toes like she would with a marble solely so she could display her control of power in front of you.\n\n§P\"Then... let's continue!\"§!\n\nAfter making a \"yay\" hand gesture to you with one hand, Yaorong refocused on the small planet between her toes - her current goal was to \"smoothly\" send the small planet that was caught between her toes into her shoe.\n\nFor the §H[root.owner_main_species.getname]§! on §H[From.GetName]§!, today is the most hopeless day in their history. Although they tried their best to resist, the toes that could crush the entire planet did not feel the slightest resistance. But aside from the suicidal defense forces, the rest of the population is very rational, and even calmly began to head to shelters to evacuate.\n\nThey had always been such resilient species - however, when they faced a god that could arbitrarily modify the laws of physics in the galaxy, resilience would only bring them more suffering.\n\n§P\"Okay... just like that...\"§!\n\nYaorong's soft sigh was transmitted not only to §H[From.GetName]§!, but also intentionally transmitted to the Imperial flagship. For the soldiers of the empire, the soft and cute voice of their Queen made all the parts of their body that could get hard, hard. But for you, you were more curious about what your girl was going to do.\n\n§P\"Okay, done! Did you see it, Father?\"§!\n\nThe girl who had successfully squeezed a planet into her shoe did not rush to her next action. Instead, she gave you a sly look with a smile - as if she was waiting for ... your praise.\n\n§P\"Oh dear, Father, why are you always so aloof? When I threw you in there, you were... Ugh, should I not have said that in front of these little guys?\"§!\n\nYaorong's obvious teasing was unable to make your emotions waver.  However, now you were not the only one who heard it - at least the soldiers on the flagship were looking at you, the Emperor Emeritus of the Empire, with a look that was seven parts envy and three parts jealousy.\n\nHowever, this was just an interlude. Yaorong eventually completed her execution while receiving your slightly dissatisfied gaze. But this last step... even the soldiers of the empire saw it as despair.\n\nAfter soaking the planet in shrinking hormones, Yaorong successfully fixed §H[From.GetName]§! inside the patterns on the insole – this act, caused by a girl who just had an impulse to play, killed nearly half of the planet, almost 3 billion lives. However, those who died in this act and those who launched a fruitless resistance were lucky, as they managed to avoid the \"hell\" that followed.\n\n§P\"Father, your current expression is making me a little bored.\"§!\n\nThe girl said with a slightly annoyed tone, and then appeared in front of the Imperial flagship - now comparable to a Sovereign-class warship, the flagship was still so small in front of Yaorong, and the cleavage between the girl's breasts alone was enough to serve as the flagship's home port.\n\n§P\"Maybe... you'd like to see this?\"§!\n\nYaorong picked up the stocking that she had just thrown onto the gas giant and, as if she were a mix of annoyed and angry, she made an extremely charming pose - it was as if a puppy, that was carrying back the frisbee you had throw, was trying to get your attention by rubbing herself against you -- but you just calmly threw the frisbee again.\n\nHowever, it has to be said, even with the filter of being \"her cub\" removed, Yoarong's behavior, that could be described as \"posing coquettishly”, was still over the top. If it weren't for the fact that royal power and divine power both resided in her, and there was supreme majesty and power on her body, the soldiers of the empire who would be seeing their queen in her current state would have already...\n\n§P\" Sigh... Why are you always like this…\"§!\n\nThe girl shook her head helplessly, and then inserted her black stocking-clad foot into the shoe. According to the original plan, the entire planet should have been completely destroyed as Yaorong stepped down. But obviously, your girl did not intend to do that now, she had been somewhat stimulated by your being indifferent - but even a puppy that just had its ears tugged, and had their butt slapped with a slipper, would not point their fangs towards their owner. And Yaorong... was the same, at least to you. The queen, whom the empire had crowned the \"World-Ending Dragon\", was nothing more than a tail-wagging puppy in front of you.\n\nThe black stocking-clad fell onto the sweat-stained insole, and all the existences within the shoe were completely crushed by the step except for the people of §H[From.GetName]§! who had been chosen to be \"executed\". From a certain point of view, the \"execution\" had now begun.\n\n§P\"It's your turn.\"§!\n\nThe atmosphere of §H[From.GetName]§! has been completely replaced by Yaorong's foot odor, and just the odor generated by a girl's physiological phenomena was enough to cover the entire planet and completely transform this world. Even the people hiding in the shelters could not escape this smell, but thankfully it was not a bone corroding poison. However, the girl's foot odor has fully captured these weak creatures.\n\nThe intelligent creatures that proclaimed themselves noble, the creatures that have broken from the shackles of gravitational fields, the creatures that have spread their territory light-years away. They became horny under the girl's foot odor, mating and engaging in behaviors that, in their eyes, belonged to inferior beings.\n\nAnd this hopeless execution would probably last forever. Their planet would forever be stuck between her stockings, and even if someone occasionally woke up and tried to save their planet. The most despairing execution would follow – their planet will be shrunk again and forever exist inside Yaorong's stockings.\n\nOr they will simply become dirt between her toes because of an unconscious foot wiggling behavior."

  # Yaorong Continued
  gts_yarong_colossus.111.name: "Physiological Function"
  gts_yarong_colossus.111.desc: "§P\"Is it here?\"§!\n\nThe girl's exquisite face blushed slightly and looked rather gorgeous... but this was only true if those who looked at Yaorong could ignore her magnificent body that was large enough to block the sun. She had used her body to smash the magnificent fleets of the stagnant authority, and she had also lowered her proud head in front of you like a puppy, wagging her tail to please you. But no matter whether she was described as the [Star Destroyer] or a small puppy in front of you , she was just a girl who was a little big.\n\nShe would show a prideful and domineering side in front of the enemy, while in front of you she would show the gentleness and coquettishness of a daughter, and in an environment where she was \"alone\" she would show her more natural self.\n\nThe luxurious black dress slowly slipped off, and Yaorong's flawless body was exposed naked to the universe. Those eyes, as bright as stars, flashed a moment of hesitation and shame, but the restlessness that came from within her body made her put down all those useless emotions.\n\nHer slender fingertips gently touched the planet that was lingering beside Yaorong's lower body. This was just an action that your child did to adjust her physiological functions, but it brought a disaster to the civilization on this planet that was no less than the apocalypse.\n\n…………\n\nThere are many natural wonders on this planet. In the early stages of this civilization, the vast rivers nurtured the intelligent life that occupied this planet. They were an advanced civilization that knew gratitude and promoted environmentalism, Even before they built FTL engines, they had already promoted environmentalism on their home planet, and they valued the natural environment that nurtured their civilization over their desire for the stars.\n\nThe milky white jade pillars that connected the heavens and the earth landed on this planet irrationally. Yaorong's action, which was meant to fix the planet in place to make her physiological behavior more comfortable, has killed tens of millions of lives. The perpetrator of this action was not even aware of how fragile and tiny the life on this planet was, so insignificant like dust and ants under her fingertips... Perhaps she was aware of it, but did she really care?\n\nAfter all, this was not just a simple act of play for her; she was following your orders... Although the process may not be what you wanted, for Yaorong, as long as the result was good, her father would not blame her.\n\n§P\"Hmm, Father's requests seem rather extravagant...\"§!\n\nAfter completing the act of fixing the planet, a feat that could be considered a miracle for that civilization, Yaorong finally remembered your instructions to her. This was an execution action, and for Yaorong, this type of execution action, aside from \"transforming the planet\", also had to let the leader of §H[gts_yarong_destroyed_country.GetName]§! know how wrong their actions against the Empire had been.\n\nYan had ruled this planet for decades. Although he would not claim himself to be a diligent and ambitious ruler, he believed that he had not failed to live by the teachings of his ancestors. He was quite satisfied with his national policy - until he personally witnessed the most magnificent peaks of his home planet being crushed by a girl's finger and turned into dirt on her finger prints, and the mother river that had nurtured his civilization being cut in half...\n\nBut that was not the end. Even though they were tens of millions of meters away, Yan could still clearly hear the words of the perpetrator of this disaster. She seemed to be just carrying out an order, and the billions of lives living on this planet were far less important to her than that order.\n\nJust as Yan was about to issue an order for evacuation, Yaorong's voice came again.\n\n§P\"Found you… the leader of the Empire.\"§!\n\nThe girl's voice was emotionless; it had neither anger nor mockery, except for the faint red tint that Yan couldn't see. Yaorong's face was as calm as when she was patrolling the borders of the empire."

  gts_yarong_colossus.112.desc: "However, from Yan's perspective, he was unable to put up any resistance and had been imprisoned within a pink world. He understood without thinking: what had just blocked out the sun's light was the girl's naked lower body that was unashamedly towering above the planet, even with the intention to kill them by urination.\n\nFor any race that had ventured into space and knew its modesty, Yaorong's action was absolutely an insult in every way - using her lower body, using her reproductive organs to stand arrogantly above the planet, even planning to kill them all through the physiological act of urination. However, the person in question did not care at all. The small stone ball that nurished billions of lives was way too insignificant for Yaorong, and the lives that lived on it were probably not even qualified to be her parasites.\n\nBut even though they know that would be impossible to resist, even though the main fleet of the empire had been eaten by Yaorong, they would still engage in pointless acts of resistance when Yaorong, her face tinted red and about to pee, aimed her urethra at the planet that has completely stopped rotating around a star. \n\nWhile Yaorong was still tightening her lower body with the purpose of stopping the planet from being destroyed by her physiological behavior too early, they had finally made a counterattack.\n\n§H[gts_yarong_destroyed_planet.GetName]§! had no starbases or shipyards now, and naturally they also lost any starships capable of FTL travel. In fact, they couldn't even put together a frigate now, and all that they can do is to use \"primitive\" warplanes loaded with tactical nuclear warheads to make an attempt at rebellion that was better than nothing.\n\nAt least hundreds of fighters rushed out in the first wave of the attack, but the closer they got to Yaorong's lower body, the more they felt their insignificance. The folds of Yaorong's lower body alone were far wider and deeper than the deepest trenches of this planet, and the canyon between her legs were tens of thousands of meters wide. Even a battleship could probably easily fit inside, not to mention those fighters that barely managed to get past the atmosphere!\n\nAfter witnessing the miraculous “scenery”, Yaorong’s feeling of a rebellion that was better than nothing, had finally arrived - the fighters, as slow as snails crawling in Yaorong’s eyes, was naturally fully visible, and the only reason they survived is because the girl was in a playful mood to see the last struggle of this weak civilization and see just what kind of sensation could they give her.\n\nFinally, the ultimate weapon of the atomic era finally played its due role. Though the world-destroying weapon ultimately struck only a girl's urethra. It cannot be called an act of glory, and in the smoke-filled dust they did not even know if this desperate attack was effective.\n\nYaorong, who was still thinking about where to start expressing her feelings, finally felt the resistance from this civilization. Although atomic weapons could not even scratch Yaorong's scales, it was different when the weapons hit her urethra, such a sensitive part.\n\n§P\"Hmm... Is that it?\"§!\n\nThe maximum amount of atomic weapons that the fighters carried only brought Yaorong a bit of itching... even though she had tightened her lower body and exposed her labia and urethra for those microbe-like beings to attack."

  gts_yarong_colossus.113.desc: "Yan watched this scene before him in despair. He witnessed with his own eyes the desperate counterattack of those suicidal people. The nuclear bombs not only failed to harm the monster that held him in check, but had instead made her more playful -- she even used her hand to lift an entire continental shelf and put it next to her lower body!\n\nHe wanted to roar, but how could that sky-blocking monster care about the roar from an entity that was even inferior to a pubic louse? He wanted to resist, but his hands and feet had long been bound by this pink land. He wanted to end his own life, and not see his subjects get subjected to such humiliating slaughter... But even death was a grace from that monster.\n\nAn entire continental shelf only occupied a quarter of Yaorong's palm, and the towering buildings and the people who were parasitic on the shelf were even smaller. But even such small civilizations that were like microbes, still chose to resist when they were faced with Yaorong's humiliating massacre.\n\nThe land-based nuclear bombs rushed out one after the other. This was a last-ditch counterattack of a suicidal people, and the most magnificent fireworks that a civilization had ignited before its demise - whether it was from her sense of dark humor or because she simply wanted to experience it, Yaorong deliberately leaned down again, and used her urethra to steadily catch their desperate counterattack. \n\n§P\"Ugh...\"§!\n\nUnlike the tactical nuclear bombs carried by the fighters, these land-based strategic nuclear bombs were created for the purpose of deterrence. The energy they possessed could destroy even a battleship under a direct hit -- but even the powerful weapons that could destroy a battleship had only caused…\n\nYaorong finally relaxed, and no longer braced her body tightly, allowing the golden urine to gush out like the flood that was described in the Bible. Of course, before making such a comfortable move, Little Dragon had already retreated her hand - she had other ways to play with the whole 'continent' that had been in her hand.\n\nApart from the first strategic nuclear missile that had successfully brought Yaorong a strange sensation, the second and subsequent strategic nuclear missiles that were about to hit Yaorong were completely destroyed by her physiological actions. The terrifying weapons that were enough to destroy a city, and even destroy a battleship, were unable to even create sparks in front of the urine that the girl had released."

  gts_yarong_colossus.114.desc: "§P\"Ah… That’s the end…\"§!\n\nYaorong did not make any unseemly moans, even though the only beings remaining in this star system were her and the little guy within her that was as inferior as a pubic louse. However, that inexplicable \"reservedness\" still allowed her to maintain the calm as always, even after making such absurd actions.\n\n§P\"Is this the last spark of the civilization?\"§!\n\nYaorong tone was still calm. However, those who were still alive and remained in the city had already knelt on the ground in despair, pleading for mercy when they were swept by those golden eyes - but Yaorong could not hear them, or she would not care even she did hear them. All that remained in her mind now was to use this continental shelf, that barely served the purpose of a tissue, to wipe away the urine that remained near her urethra.\n\n§P\"It's actually... quite useful.\"§!\n\nThe continental shelf with more than 500 million people, hundreds of giant urban settlements, and complete terrain was used by the girl as a tissue to wipe her lower body. The moment it came into contact with Yaorong's tender flesh, all intelligent life on the shelf was annihilated, leaving only their corpses and the once glorious urban remains to rub against the girl's urethra...\n\n§P\"I hope Father won't blame me...\"§!\n\nLooking at the planet made of golden urine that was emanating a faint ammonia smell, Yaorong's face was still flushed – she did not care about the destruction that her physiological behavior would cause, but she did care about your opinion. In fact, if you directly told her not to do it, she would definitely follow that order… even if some dissatisfaction hid in her heart.\n\nFinally, after putting her clothes back on, Yaorong finally remembered what you had told her - to let the leader of §H[gts_yarong_destroyed_country.GetName]§! know their mistake. However, she frowned and looked away after glancing at the planet that had been completely replaced by her own urine. She knew that she was just going to be scolded if she gave you such a result.\n\nFortunately, Yaorong finally remembered that she had already done most of what you had assigned her before the execution even started.\n\n§P\"Oh, I almost forgot about you, poor little thing. You must hate me, right? The place you lived for generations just disappeared like that. But don't worry, you'll be able to join it soon.\"§!\n\nYaorong's sneer finally shattered Yan's last defense… But now he could only live in Yaorong's urethra, relying on the supplies from the cities of his former compatriots, or just surviving off Yaorong’s urine.\n\nWill he succeed in his revenge?\n\nOr, will he become an inconspicuous pubic louse on Yaorong's body?\n\nYaorong did not care.  She had simply completed the task you had assigned her and also solved her bodily needs - as for the 6.5 billion lives that died under her urine… Yaorong had never cared about them from the very beginning."
