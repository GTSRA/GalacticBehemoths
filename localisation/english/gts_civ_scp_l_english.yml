  civic_gts_scp: "GTS Foundation"
  civic_gts_scp_desc: "An ancient secret organization operating in the shadows of this nation, aiming to control, contain, and protect those 'abnormal' phenomena of girls growing to giant sizes, all in an effort to safeguard the civilization's legacy unknowingly from the hands of giantesses. To achieve this goal, they often prefer using their own methods over conventional diplomatic means."

  civic_gts_scp_effects: "Unlocks several new espionage operations."
  councilor_gts_scp: "Foundation Liaison"
  councilor_gts_scp_female: "Foundation Liaison"

  councilor_gts_scp_desc: "As the pivotal link between the Foundation and the government, the liaison plays a crucial role in facilitating their cooperation."
  operation_gts_find_abnormal: "Foundation - Contain Anomaly"
  operation_gts_find_abnormal_desc: "There are a significant number of 'anomalies' present in other nations' colonies, and we need to utilize our espionage network to bypass troublesome diplomatic procedures and swiftly complete containment without detection."
  operation_gts_find_abnormal_on_success: "$IF_SUCCESSFUL|E$\nGain 6 months' worth of research points."
  operation_gts_research_abnormal: "Foundation - Research Anomaly"
  operation_gts_research_abnormal_desc: "Bringing other nations' 'anomalous' phenomena back to our country for research is both dangerous and overly time-consuming. Once fully prepared, we can utilize our espionage network for onsite research on these 'anomalies' within that nation. Phenomena like 'suddenly disappearing towns' or 'giant footprints appearing without reason' will be covered up by our controlled media as urban legends."
  operation_gts_research_abnormal_on_success: "$IF_SUCCESSFUL|E$\nGain 48 months' worth of research points, causing some disruption in the target country."
  operation_gts_research_over: "The nation has become aware of our research activity. It's advisable to switch to another country for research in the short term."
  operation_gts_fire_abnormal: "Foundation - Trigger Anomaly"
  operation_gts_fire_abnormal_desc: "Decades of experience have allowed us to glimpse a fragment of the complex workings behind these 'anomalies.' We can attempt to activate an 'anomaly' - such as transforming an ordinary woman into a giant girl, thereby unleashing her nature, to substantiate some of our hypotheses. Naturally, to ensure the safety of the containment headquarters, these 'anomalies' will be deployed in other nations."
  operation_gts_fire_abnormal_on_success: "$IF_SUCCESSFUL|E$\nCreate a destruction-loving giantess on a planet in the target country."
  gts_city_mistory: "Urban Legend"
  gts_city_mistory_desc: "Some unsettling urban legends are circulating among the people. These partially confirmed reports undoubtedly cause great societal panic."
  gts_army: "Giantess"
  gts_army_desc: "A girl who seems slightly oversized for her surroundings, whose tiniest movements are akin to a natural disaster for the environment around her."

  NAME_GTS: "\"Anomaly\""
  gts_civ_scp.1.name: "Containment Complete"
  gts_civ_scp.1.desc: "As planned, we have successfully completed this containment operation. The number of D-class personnel expended to contain the giant anomaly is within control, and after replenishment, we can proceed with the next containment action."
  gts_civ_scp.1.a: "Very good."
  gts_civ_scp.2.name: "Investigation Complete"
  gts_civ_scp.2.desc: "Our investigation was successfully completed, and we obtained the information we wanted to understand, greatly aiding our future containment actions. But it should be noted that our actions have already raised the alertness of the opposing nation. Upon evaluation, the Foundation has decided to suspend investigation activities in the target nation for five standard years."
  gts_civ_scp.2.a: "Received."
  gts_civ_scp.4.name: "Urban Legend"
  gts_civ_scp.4.desc: "Some unsettling urban legends are widely circulating among the populace recently, such as large towns disappearing overnight and sinkholes created by unknown creatures. Although these rumors have been exaggerated with embellishments, the basic facts have been verified by our investigators as true. We have done our utmost to request the media to reduce reports on such matters, but these terrifying events that occur without pattern and with high frequency undoubtedly cast a shadow over public safety and the legitimacy of our government."
  gts_civ_scp.4.a: "Is it really true?"
  gts_civ_scp.5.name: "Preparation Complete"
  gts_civ_scp.5.desc: "Our agents have successfully selected a female meeting the 'anomaly' criteria: young, still in school or just started working, relatively solitary in nature, with strong sexual desires and potential destructive tendencies. As planned, she was injected with drugs, enhancing psychic potential and instinctive impulses while she slept. This will cause her to succumb to 'anomalous' influences after an emotional upheaval, transforming into a giant girl who can easily raze large cities and planetary garrisons. Even if the nation manages to defeat her, they will merely conclude that her uncontrolled powerful psychic energy went on a rampage due to subspace forces. Our agents have all withdrawn, leaving only a few D-class personnel for surveillance."
  gts_civ_scp.5.a: "Very good."
  gts_civ_scp.7.name: "Giantess Attack!"
  gts_civ_scp.7.desc: "Urgent report! One of our planets was suddenly attacked by a giantess! According to surviving witnesses, the giantess was once an ordinary citizen of the planet. During a violent confrontation this morning, her body suddenly enlarged, destroying vast sections of the city. After ceasing to grow, she began indiscriminately attacking other districts and... pleasuring herself. This unexpected assault has made it challenging for us to immediately organize forces to defeat this calamity, and the death toll and property damage from this disaster are immeasurable..."

  gts_civ_scp.7.a: "What?!"
 # 完成收容
 gts_civ_scp.21.name:0 "Containment Complete"
 # 本次收容行动如我们按计划顺利完成了，在收容该巨大化现象时我们耗费的D级人员数量尚在控制范围内，补充完毕后我们就可以开展下一次收容行动了
 gts_civ_scp.21.desc:0 "This containment operation was completed as planned. The number of D-class personnel consumed during containment of this gigantification phenomenon is within control. After replenishment, we can launch the next containment operation."
 # 很好
 gts_civ_scp.21.a:0 "Excellent"
 # 调查结束
 gts_civ_scp.22.name:0 "Investigation Ended"
 # 我们的调查行动顺利完成，我们得到了我们希望了解的相关信息，对我们未来的收容行动有很大的帮助。但应注意到我们的行动已经引起了对方国家的警觉，经评估基金会决定暂缓在目标国家的调查活动3标准年
 gts_civ_scp.22.desc:0 "Our investigation was successfully completed. We obtained relevant information we hoped for, which helps our future containment operations greatly. But noting our action has alerted the target nation, the Foundation decided to suspend investigation activities in the target nation for 3 standard years."
 # 收到
 gts_civ_scp.22.a:0 "Received"
 # 准备完成
 gts_civ_scp.23.name:0 "Preparation Complete"
 # 我们的特工已经成功在§Y[event_target:gts_bruh_get_event_location.GetName]§!上选择了一群符合"异常\"条件的女性：年轻、还在上学或刚刚参加工作、性格相对孤僻、具有较强的性欲和潜在的破坏倾向。按照计划，她们在睡梦中被我们的小人干员潜入身边注射了能极大提升灵能潜力和本能冲动的药物。这样她们将会在一次情绪严重波动后，受到\"异常"影响，变成能够轻松摧毁大片城市和星球驻军的巨大少女。而即使她们被该国侥幸击败，她们也只将结果归咎于其无处宣泄的强大灵能被亚空间力量所控制暴走。我们的特工已经全部撤退，只剩下少数负责监视的D级人员
 gts_civ_scp.23.desc:0 "Our agents successfully selected a group of women meeting 'anomaly' conditions on §Y[event_target:gts_bruh_get_event_location.GetName]§!: young, students or just started working, relatively withdrawn personality, strong libido and potential destructive tendency. According to plan, they were injected with drugs greatly enhancing psionic potential and instinctual impulse by our small folk agents while sleeping. Thus, after a severe emotional fluctuation, they will be affected by 'anomaly', becoming giant maidens capable of easily destroying large cities and planetary garrisons. Even if defeated by luck, they will only attribute the result to their unvented powerful psionic power running wild controlled by warp forces. Our agents have all retreated, leaving only a few D-class personnel for monitoring."
 # 很好
 gts_civ_scp.23.a:0 "Excellent"
 # 都市传说
 gts_civ_scp.31.name:0 "Urban Legend"
 # 一些令人不安的都市传说最近在民间广泛流传，例如一夜间消失的大型市镇，以及被不明生物踩出的天坑。虽然这些谣言被进行了添油加醋的夸张，但基本事实都已经被我们的调查人员证明属实。我们已经尽可能要求媒体减少这类事情的报道，但这种无规律可寻又频繁发生的恐怖事件无疑给群众的安全感和我国政府的合法性覆上了一层阴霾
 gts_civ_scp.31.desc:0 "Some disturbing urban legends have been widely circulating among the public recently, such as large towns disappearing overnight, and sinkholes trampled by unknown creatures. Although these rumors were exaggerated, basic facts have been proven true by our investigators. We have minimized media reports on such matters, but these irregular and frequent horror events undoubtedly cast a shadow on public security and our government's legitimacy."
 # 居然是真的吗？
 gts_civ_scp.31.a:0 "Is it true?"
 # 巨娘袭击！
 gts_civ_scp.32.name:0 "Giantess Attack!"
 # 急报！我们的一颗星球突然遭到了巨娘袭击！根据了解情况的幸存者说，这群巨娘原本是这个星球的普通公民，在今早她和别人的一次剧烈冲突中其身体突然变大，摧毁了周围大片城区。停止变大后，她们便开始对其他辖区开始了无差别攻击和...自慰。这猝不及防的进攻让我们很难立刻组织人手击败这个灾祸，而这次灾难中的死亡人数和财产损失更是难以估量...
 gts_civ_scp.32.desc:0 "Urgent! A planet of ours was suddenly attacked by Giantesses! According to informed survivors, these Giantesses were ordinary citizens of this planet. After a fierce conflict with others this morning, their bodies suddenly grew larger, destroying large surrounding urban areas. After stopping growth, they began indiscriminate attacks and... masturbation on other districts. This sudden attack makes it hard for us to organize manpower to defeat this disaster immediately, and casualties and property losses are immeasurable..."
 # 什么？！
 gts_civ_scp.32.a:0 "What?!"
